				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So a few months ago I decided to see how easy it was to buy an SSL certificate for a domain I didn&#8217;t own. It turns out that it was very easy because at least one large certificate authority (CA), RapidSSL (owned by Verisign) allowed a large number of email addresses to be used for verification (such as ssladministrator@, it@, etc.).</p>
<p>The original article is available here: <a title="Breach of trust" href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/114/054-055_kurt.pdf">http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/114/054-055_kurt.pdf</a>. I also contacted the Mozilla/Firefox people through the <a title="mozilla.dev.security.policy" href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.security.policy/topics">mozilla.dev.security.policy</a> mailing list to let them know about it and to show the proof (the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto/msg/8f9ccde899d5c088">emails from RapidSSL to me</a>). Betanews ran a nice article (<a title="Security researcher: 'Trivially easy' to buy SSL certificate for domain you don't own" href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Security-researcher-Trivially-easy-to-buy-SSL-certificate-for-domain-you-dont-own/1270072287">http://www.betanews.com/article/Security-researcher-Trivially-easy-to-buy-SSL-certificate-for-domain-you-dont-own/1270072287</a>), and not much else happened for a while.</p>
<p>Things finally got rolling when a Bugzilla report was filed (<a title="Bug 556468  - Investigate incident with RapidSSL that issued SSL certificate for portugalmail.pt  " href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=556468">Bug 556468</a>, which was basically a copy of an older bug <a title="Bug 477783  - Equifax not conforming to Mozilla CA Certificate Policy (7)  " href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=477783">Bug 477783</a> concerning Equifax doing basically the same thing). A Verisign representative confirmed they had removed a bunch of problematic email addresses they allowed, but ssladmin@ was still valid (this turned out to be a mistake as you&#8217;ll soon see).</p>
<p>Fast forward about two weeks and someone has copied my article and thrown in a few screen shots and submitted it to Slashdot (<a title="Become an SSLAdmin In a Few Easy Steps" href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/04/18/1218212/Become-an-SSLAdmin-In-a-Few-Easy-Steps">http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/04/18/1218212/Become-an-SSLAdmin-In-a-Few-Easy-Steps</a>) personally I don&#8217;t mind if people copy my work and build off of it, but when they protray it as their own original work with no credit or original source mentioned that is a bit annoying.</p>
<p>Although annoying it had the benefit of showing the world that by using the ssladmin@ email address (remember, the one Verisign didn&#8217;t remove) which resulted in the rather quick disabling of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>VeriSign will be removing the following generic approver email options for GeoTrust and RapidSSL as of tonight or tomorrow night:</p>
<p>&#8211; ssladmin, sysadmin, and info</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess in the end it worked, certificates are hopefully a little more secure now but the sad thing is I spent several dozen hours basically holding vendors feet to the fire for something they should have been doing all along.</p>
<p>Oh and there is no way to find out if a certificate authority has issued a certificate for your domain to someone else. Unlike DNS/etc. there is no way to query what certificates have been issued.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kurtseifried.wordpress.com/7/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kurtseifried.wordpress.com/7/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kurt.seifried.org&#038;blog=86342&#038;post=7&#038;subd=kurtseifried&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
