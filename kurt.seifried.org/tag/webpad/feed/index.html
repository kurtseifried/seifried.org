				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want a web pad.  I find myself using my netbooks more and more mostly because they aren&#8217;t a pain to lug around, and with an SSD an 9 cell battery I can get 8-9 hours of use (wifi, watching movies, etc.) out of it (basically a full day no problem). Like many people I&#8217;m spending more time online, what would have been &#8220;offline&#8221; tasks in the past (writing an article, replying to email, etc.) are now online activities, fact checking, etc.  in real time rather then leaving a note and waiting until later. This is finally practical, home, coffee shops, etc. all have wireless access, and if they don&#8217;t I can use my iPhone (which sucks hard for data speeds downtown but that&#8217;s another story) which has free tethering (thanks Fido). If I can&#8217;t get online there is precious little work I can do. Even my accountant agrees (they seem to embrace technology, but only if it is reliable, proven and cost effective, so they&#8217;re usually a few revs behind everyone), when his network goes out he takes off for a round of golf.</p>
<p>My requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>browse the web and support JavaScript well (Gmail, Google Docs, etc.)</li>
<li>allow me to view PDF files</li>
<li>support rotate (i.e. portrait and landscape view) with no hassle</li>
<li>support 802.11 and WEP/WPA/WPA2</li>
<li>at least 6 hours of battery life</li>
<li>9 inches minimum</li>
<li>audio jack for head phones</li>
<li>$500-600 max</li>
</ul>
<p>My wishlist would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>11-13 inches screen size</li>
<li>audio jacks for microphone</li>
<li>as much battery life as possible</li>
<li>ability to run software I want to run (basically everything but the iPad)</li>
<li>Bluetooth for keyboard/mouse</li>
<li>Watch .avi files (movies)</li>
<li>Flash would be nice but I suspect I can live without it</li>
<li>Android or Linux based</li>
</ul>
<p>Hardware specs: apart from screen size who gives a flip anymore as long as it does the above tasks. Seriously. Hardware is all pretty mucch fast at this point, the over reliance on specs (this one has a CPU 0.1Ghz faster than this other thing) is a bit dated I think.</p>
<p>Sadly I realize I&#8217;m willing to give up the ability to run software of my choosing in order to get this device. I&#8217;v already done this with the iPhone (of the 7 SSH clients I tested none are great and half are complete garbage). I am not used to having devices capable of general computing (as opposed to an MP3 player) that I don&#8217;t actually control and have the ability to run the software I want to run but I realize I&#8217;m willing to give it up for the convenience of devices like the iPhone (I feel so dirty).</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve decided I will be buying a tablet/web pad (whatever we&#8217;re calling it now) this year once I can find one that doesn&#8217;t suck as bad as the iPad does in some respects.</p>
<p>Current contenders are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wepad.mobi/en">WePad</a></li>
<li>Asus Eee tablet</li>
<li>???</li>
