<P>The ports collection is the primary interface for installing
additional software on OpenBSD. It consists of makefiles, information
about the programs, and patch files needed to compile them
successfully on OpenBSD. You will need the compXX.tgz (where XX is
your version of OpenBSD) installed to compile software in ports.
However you can compile ports on a machine and take the installation
package it creates and use it on another machine, allowing you to
quickly deploy software to numerous systems.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Downloading and installing the ports tree</H2>
<P>Ports consists of a large tarball available on OpenBSD ftp sites
and the CD's. You download &quot;ports.tar.gz&quot; and unpack it in
&quot;/usr/&quot; so that you have a tree of directories and files in
&quot;/usr/ports/&quot; (hence the name &quot;ports tree&quot;).

<H2>Finding things in ports</H2>
<P>There are a number of ways to find things in ports. Commonly
simply cd'ing to the appropriate directory and issuing an ls will
list likely candidate programs, with security programs in the
security directory, network packages in net and so on. If you are
looking for a specific application or a keyword, such as &quot;vpn&quot;
then you simply use the make command in the root of the ports tree:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG># cd /usr/ports<BR># make search key=vpn</STRONG><BR>Port:

<P>Please note that keywords may not be intuitive, for example when
searching for an email server using the keyword &quot;smtp&quot;
results in only one port being listed, &quot;smtpclient&quot;. Using
more generic keywords will result in more results, of which typically
only the name, path and information fields are wanted. To list only
these portions of the ports info when using search simply use grep to
cull the results down. To list all the web browsers for example
simply use the following command:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG># make search key=&quot;web browser&quot; | grep

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To find the maintainer of a specific package you can search the
Makefile, or use the make command to list them:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"># cd /usr/ports/security/nessus
# make show VARNAME=MAINTAINER 
or
# grep &quot;^MAINTAINER&quot; Makefile</PRE><P>
&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Building and installing things from ports</H2>
<P>Once you have found what you want you will need to build the port
and install it. Many ports require other things in ports to be
present, such as &quot;gmake&quot;, if such a dependency is present
when you issue the &quot;make&quot; command the dependencies will
automatically be built first and installed. This can lead to some
problems on non standard systems that require specific make options,
you should first build things in /usr/ports/devel/ that you will
probably need such as &quot;gmake&quot; or any language specific
items like &quot;ORBit&quot; or &quot;jdk&quot;. To build a port
simply cd into the appropriate directory and issue the make command:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG># cd /usr/ports/security/gpgme/<BR># make</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The first thing that will happen is any dependencies are satisfied
first. Then it will download the package from the ftp or web site if
it is not present in /usr/ports/distfiles. The package is then
uncompressed and un-tar'ed as needed, any patch files are applied,
and the package is then built using the appropriate tools (make and
Makefiles, a shell script, etc.). At this point the software has been
built but not yet installed. If the last thing you see are error
messages then you will need to take corrective actions (try using an
older or newer version of the software, check the mailing lists,
etc.).
</P>
<P>To install the software you will need to issue a second command,
&quot;make install&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG># make install</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The first thing you will see is a line such as:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>===&gt; Faking installation for gpgme-0.3.4</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And the last set of lines you should see will be something like:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>===&gt; Building package for gpgme-0.3.4<BR>Creating
package /usr/ports/packages/i386/All/gpgme-0.3.4.tgz<BR>Using SrcDir
value of
/usr/ports/security/gpgme/w-gpgme-0.3.4/fake-i386/usr/local<BR>Creating
gzip'd tar ball in
'/usr/ports/packages/i386/All/gpgme-0.3.4.tgz'<BR>===&gt; gpgme-0.3.4
depends on: gnupg-* - found<BR>===&gt; Installing gpgme-0.3.4 from
/usr/ports/packages/i386/All/gpgme-0.3.4.tgz</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Essentially the system creates the installable package first and
then install it, rather then installing from the source code
directly. This ensures consistency across systems and also provides
one last sanity check, allowing the ports maintainer to control the
location files are installed to rather then the author of the
software (i.e. /bin vs.s /usr/local/bin vs.s. /opt/bin vs.s.
/nfs-exports/openbsd/3.1/bin and so on).
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Using &quot;flavors&quot;</H2>
<P>Some ports support &quot;flavors&quot;, this can range from
something simple like building a program without X windows support
(for example Nessus which includes a server component, and client
components) to which version of a program to use (such as &quot;pgp&quot;
or &quot;pgp5&quot;). Other flavors commands can include keywords
such as &quot;static&quot; (i.e. to build the binary statically and
not use dynamically linked libraries). Flavors are extremely simply
to use, you append the command &quot;flavor='foo'&quot; to the make
command, such as:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG># make flavor='no_x11'</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The quickest way to find if a port has flavors is to simply grep
the Makefile for &quot;FLAVORS&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG># grep FLAVORS
/usr/ports/net/bind9/Makefile</STRONG><BR>/usr/ports/net/bind9/Makefile:FLAVORS=
debug static threads</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thus you can see that Bind 9 can be built using threads,
statically or with debugging capabilities. Typically flavors are not
required, the major exception being &quot;no_x11&quot; which is very
common on headless servers and the like.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Installing precompiled packages</H2>
<P>Precompiled software packages for OpenBSD are available on the
official vendor CD's, and any packages you build in ports will be
available in /usr/ports/packages/ARCHITECTURE/All/. Some software
vendors also make binary packages available to spare users the
trouble or to prevent source code from being distributed. To install
such precompiled packages simply use the &quot;pkd_add&quot; command:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG># pkg_add -v gpgme-0.3.4.tgz </STRONG><BR>Requested

<P>You can change the location used to unpack the file using the &quot;-t&quot;
option, if you are installing a large package to /usr/ for example
and /tmp is on a separate disk it may be faster to unpack to /usr/
and install from there then from /tmp.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>What to do when things won't build</H2>
<P>Ports will almost always build, but that is not to say they will
always work. Some of the more common problems are:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Inability to download the source
code
</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The source code signatures have
changed
</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A broken dependency port
</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Broken source code or source code
incompatible with current OpenBSD
</P>
<LI><P>Something on your system is broken, such as &quot;make&quot;
</P>
</UL>
<P>The first thing to check is the source code, did it get
downloaded, if yes it should be present in &quot;/usr/ports/distfiles&quot;.
This can be due to the source code being modified but not renumbered,
ports files usually have an MD5 and SHA1 signature of the source code
tarball, if they don't match the port will not compile it by default.
Changing the Makefile to ignore this signature and compile in any
event is dangerous. Please see more on this in the security section.
</P>
<P>The next thing to do is check the output of the compile, common
errors include things like &quot;can't find library...&quot; or
&quot;patch file hunk failed to apply...&quot; most of these messages
are reasonably self explanatory, if patch files aren't applying
properly then either the patch file or the source code has changed
enough to break it, manually checking files and modifying the patch
is one approach, simply downloading newer software another. Another
common reason for these errors is something on the system is broken,
have you recently removed any files or directories to save space?
This is a common mistake that can lead to problems. You should also
check what version of OpenBSD you are using, if it's 2.x-stable then
it may be time to upgrade, GCC is currently going through major
changes as vendors start to ship the next major release (3.x), and
many software packages have errors that GCC 2.x will accept and
process but that GCC 3.x will not (being somewhat more strict in it's
input).
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Security issues in ports</H2>
<P>Ports relies primarily on third party software vendors ranging
from individuals to organizations such as the Apache group. While
efforts are made to ensure the code is reasonable correct the
software in ports is not audited to nearly the degree that OpenBSD
is. Furthermore there have been several incidents of sites such as
monkey.org being broken into and software packages hosted there being
modified, ranging from additional commands in the Makefiles to actual
modification of the source code. For this reason OpenBSD includes MD5
sums of the packages, if modified the MD5 sum will not match and a
warning will be issued, <STRONG>DO NOT IGNORE THESE WARNINGS</STRONG>.
While they are often false positives due to a package being updated
they should be investigated before continuing as you are putting your
system at risk.
</P>
<P>You can change ownership of the &quot;/usr/ports&quot; directory
to a non root user such as &quot;portuser&quot; and then compile all
packages as this user. You will also want to create /etc/mk.conf and
add the following line to it:</P>
<PRE>SUDO=/usr/bin/sudo</PRE><P>
<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This will greatly simplify the task of creating ports as a non
root user. The user building ports should of course have sudo access.
</P>
<P>Building ports as a non root user decreases the risk of a security
incident, several programs in ports were found to have compromised
distribution source code which created a root shell bound to the
network if the port was compiled as root, if the port had been
compiled as a user this would not have been an issue. However if an
attacker can subvert your ports files, or the software you download
they can compromise your system since the compiled package must be
installed by root in any event. Please note this will break some
ports when trying to compile them or create the packages as non-root
users will not be able to set file permissions to other users or
create setuid/setgid files.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Bandwidth saving techniques for ports</H2>
<P>There are a number of ways to save bandwidth when making ports
files. The first most obvious way is to purchase the OpenBSD CD's
which come with a wide variety of prebuilt packages such as bash and
emacs and other commonly used software. The second major bandwidth
saving technique is to keep a copy of the source code required for
the build locally, you can then use it by copying it into
/usr/ports/distfiles/, or by making it available on a local server
and modifying the locations in the Makefile for the program. This is
ideal for administrators with multiple architectures or systems
spanning multiple version of OpenBSD and libraries who wish to
install the latest version of emacs for example on all their systems.
The third method is to take the compiled packages, stored in
/usr/ports/packages/ARCHITECTURE/All/ and copy them over to other
systems and then use &quot;pkg_add&quot; to install them, this also
saves on compiler time.
