<hr>
<p>Many security problems arise from the simple fact that you
must allow user access to your systems. In some cases users can
be malicious (i.e. internal attacker, university students, etc.)
or they may accidentally expose their password to an attacker or
simply use a weak password (like their username). In any event it
is all to possible for users to attack a system, so it is
advisable to monitor users, and limit the amount of damage they
can do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Limiting user commands">Limiting user commands</a></h2>
<p>Most UNIX systems allow all users to execute all commands. For
example the &quot;route&quot; command, any user can execute it,
however to use it to alter the routing tables (i.e. add, delete
or modify routes) you must be root:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>bash-2.05$ id
uid=1000(seifried) gid=1000(seifried) groups=1000(seifried)
bash-2.05$ route delete 0.0.0.0
route: must be root to alter routing table: Permission denied
bash-2.05$ route show
Routing tables

Internet:
Destination      Gateway            Flags 
default          1.2.3.4            UG     
10.0.0.0         link#2             U     </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It is advisable to remove the execute bit for
&quot;other&quot; (i.e. chmod o-x) on potentially dangerous
binaries, especially system utilities (such as the contents of
/sbin/*). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Restricting access to cron and at</h2>
<p>Users can sometimes avoid execution restrictions and other
limits by scheduling jobs to run via cron or at. For example if
you place a CPU limit on users if they leave an IRC boot running
the system will eventually kill it. If the user has access to
cron or at however they can simply schedule a job to run once a
minute that checks to see if the IRC bot is running, and if it is
not running it will be started. Thus whenever the system kills
the bot it will be restarted less then a minute later
automatically, allowing it to consume resources with ease. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Restricting access to cron</h3>
<p>You can restrict access to cron in two ways, either by
explicitly allowing only certain users to use it, or by
explicitly denying certain users. To deny certain users simply
list them in &quot;/var/cron/deny&quot;, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>bash-2.05# cat /var/cron/deny 
seifried</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To deny all users and only allow certain users simply list the
users in &quot;/var/cron/allow&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>bash-2.05# cat /var/cron/allow 
root</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can view all the crontab entries in
&quot;/var/cron/tabs/&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Restricting access to at</h3>
<p>You can restrict access to at in two ways, either by
explicitly allowing only certain users to use it, or by
explicitly denying certain users. To deny certain users simply
list them in &quot;/var/at/at.deny&quot;, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>bash-2.05# cat /var/at/at.deny 
seifried</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To deny all users and only allow certain users simply list the
users in &quot;/var/at/at.allow&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>bash-2.05# cat /var/at/at.allow 
root</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can view all the at entries in &quot;/var/at/jobs/&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Limiting user resources">Limiting user resources</a>
</h2>
<p>Users require resources like CPU time, memory and drive space
to do their work. On many systems it is possible for users to hog
resources, reducing the usefulness of the system to other users
or in some cases actually bringing the server to a slow halt or
crashing it. Users can also inadvertently use up more resources
then they mean to, limiting their resources can prevent several
classes of problems. Programs can crash. generating huge core
dumps, or go crazy and user up all the available memory.
Something to remember: global limits apply to root, so be
careful! If you do not allow root to run enough processes for
example cron jobs may fail or you may not even be able to log in
to fix any problems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>login.conf</h3>
<p>OpenBSD does not use PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to
authenticate logins and enforce user limits, instead it uses
login.conf. login.conf in OpenBSD provides most of the same
features PAM does with a few notable exceptions, the largest
being the inability to limit the number of user logins by user or
group. </p>
<p>You can limit user access to resources by editing
&quot;/etc/login.conf&quot;, limits can be placed on individual
users, groups or &quot;default&quot; (any users without a valid
login class). </p>
<p>The available limits are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>coredumpsize</b> -- Limits the core file size; usually
set to 0 for most users to prevent core dumps.<br>
<strong>datasize</strong> -- Maximum data size <br>
<b>filesize</b> -- Maximum file size<br>
<b>memorylocked</b> -- Maximum locked-in core memory address
space (KB).<br>
<b>memoryuse</b> -- Maximum core memory address space in use
(KB).<br>
<b>openfiles</b> -- Maximum number of open files per process.<br>
<b>stacksize</b> -- Maximum stack size<br>
<b>cputime</b> -- Maximum CPU time<br>
<b>maxproc</b> -- Maximum number of processes.<br>
<b>priority</b> -- The priority to run user process with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Limits can be set with &quot;-max&quot; and &quot;-cur&quot;,
essentially a hard and soft limit, simply append &quot;-max&quot;
or &quot;-cur&quot; to the capability name. Please see
login.conf(5) <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=login.conf&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bash</h3>
<p>Bash has built in limits, accessed via &#147;ulimit&#148;. Any
hard limits cannot be set higher, so if you have limits defined
in /etc/profile, or in the users .bash_profile (assuming they
cannot edit/delete .bash_profile) you can enforce limits on users
with Bash shells. You must also ensure that the user cannot
change their login shell, if they use &quot;chsh&quot; to change
their shell to ksh for example the next time they login they will
have no limits (assuming you cave not put limits on ksh).
Documentation is available on ulimit, log in using bash and

ulimit: ulimit [-SHacdflmnpstuv] [limit]
    Ulimit provides control over the resources available to processes
    started by the shell, on systems that allow such control.  If an
    option is given, it is interpreted as follows:
    
        -S      use the `soft' resource limit
        -H      use the `hard' resource limit
        -a      all current limits are reported
        -c      the maximum size of core files created
        -d      the maximum size of a process's data segment
        -f      the maximum size of files created by the shell
        -l      the maximum size a process may lock into memory
        -m      the maximum resident set size
        -n      the maximum number of open file descriptors
        -p      the pipe buffer size
        -s      the maximum stack size
        -t      the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
        -u      the maximum number of user processes
        -v      the size of virtual memory
    
    If LIMIT is given, it is the new value of the specified resource.
    Otherwise, the current value of the specified resource is printed.
    If no option is given, then -f is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte
    increments, except for -t, which is in seconds, -p, which is in
    increments of 512 bytes, and -u, which is an unscaled number of
    processes.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To disallow core files (by setting the maximum size to 0) for
example you would add:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ulimit -Hc 0</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To set limits globally you would need to edit
&quot;/etc/profile&quot;, of course this will also affect root,
so be careful! To set limits on groups you would need to add
scripting to &quot;/etc/profile&quot; that would check for the
user's membership in a group and then apply the statements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Disk usage quota's</h3>
<p>Quota allows you to enforce user and group limits on disk
usage. Quotas are most often used to prevents users from hogging
disk space that is shared with other users (i.e.
&quot;/home&quot;). There are several benefits to using quota
instead of shell limitations; the first being that you can apply
it selectively to disk systems, i.e. you can place a limit on
/home/ but not on /tmp/. Additionally you can place limits on the
number of inodes used as well as space, running out of inodes is
as bad as running out of space since you won't be able to create
new files. To see how much space a disk has (in kilobytes):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>bash-2.05# <strong>df -k</strong>
Filesystem  1K-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/wd0a     3969655   866510  2904663    23%    /</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And to show inode usage:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>bash-2.05# <strong>df -i</strong>
Filesystem  512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity iused   ifree  %iused  Mounted on
/dev/wd0a      7939310  1733020  5809326    23%   85472  887582     9%   /</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To enable quota's you first need to edit /etc/fstab and add a
&quot;userquota&quot; or &quot;groupquota&quot; directive to the
options for each filesystem you wish to enable quotas on, for
example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/dev/wd0b /tmp ffs rw 1 1
/dev/wd0c /home ffs rw 1 1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's say you want to add quota support to /tmp for groups
only, and quota support to /home for users and groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/dev/wd0b /tmp ffs rw,groupquota=/admin/tmp-quota.group 1 1
/dev/wd0c /home ffs rw,userquota=/home/quota.user,groupquota=/home/quota.group 1 1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>After editing &quot;/etc/fstab&quot; you will need to turn
quotas on for each filesystem:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>quotaon /dev/wd0b
quotaon /dev/wd0c</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You should also ensure that &quot;check_quotas&quot; in
&quot;/etc/rc.conf&quot; is set to &quot;YES&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>check_quotas=YES</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can then edit user and group quotas with
&quot;edquota&quot;, it will drop you into your default editor
(typically vi) and allow you to manipulate the disk quota's, both
space allowed and inodes. If you permit a large enough amount of
space and do not restricted the number of inodes a user can use
they may be able to enough inodes to cause problems. The simplest
example is if a user touches a large number of files, thus
creating empty files that take up an inode, and use very little
space. </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>bash-2.05a$ <strong>quota</strong>
Disk quotas for user seifried (uid 1000): 
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
              /     155 1000000 1000000           18334 1000000 1000000        </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see the number of inodes used is disproportionate
to the size of the files. </p>
<p>Typically you will only need to place quota on file systems
directly writeable to the user, usually this consists of:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/tmp
/var
/home</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Soft limits will generate warnings and hard limits will stop
the user from using more disk space or inodes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Monitoring users">Monitoring users</a></h2>
<p>Monitoring users may be a requirement of your security policy,
or you may have discovered an account that has been compromised
and you wish to monitor the attacker when they use it.
Unfortunately while this used to be relatively easy there are now
a number of new issues that make monitoring users problematic.
The increased usage of encrypted protocols like SSH and SSL mean
you can no longer simply run a packet sniffer and monitor the
attacker. Typically the best way to monitor users is
transparently, packet sniffers are ideal for this as you need not
make any changes on the server at all. The second best is to use
some form of monitoring on the server, this used to be possible
with ttysnoop however ttysnoop does not appear to be actively
maintained anymore. While you can use tricks like shell logging
this will be obvious to a skilled attacker as the first thing
they usually do is disable shell logging. If you are monitoring
legitimate users you should inform them (this is a legal
requirement in some countries and states). If you are monitoring
an attacker and intend to use the log files as evidence you
should probably consult a lawyer to make sure it is done
correctly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>sshsniff</h3>
<p>This is actually a really useful tool I stumbled across. It
allows you to monitor all traffic going in and coming out of a
process, such as an interactive shell. The bad news is that it
does not appear to be completely reliable. While testing it
sshsniff reliably captured keystrokes sent to the shell and the
replies, however when files were cat'ed, i.e. &quot;cat
/etc/passwd&quot; the file was not always displayed on the
monitoring shell:</p>

<p>sshsniff is not perfect but it is able to bind to any PID and
not just terminals, making it very flexible. You can download it
from: <a href="http://www.psychoid.lam3rz.de/exploits.html">http://www.psychoid.lam3rz.de/exploits.html</a>.
One note there is a file called col.c that contains an entry for
/etc/passwd, it does not appear to be used but it does raise some
questions. If you plan to use this code I strongly suggest you
audit it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>dsniff</h3>
<p>With protocols like SSH and SSL being widely deployed simple
packet sniffers are no longer as useful as they once were. So
people started writing more complex packet sniffers, like dsniff.
dsniff is capable of doing man in the middle attacks against SSL
and SSH. If you control the server then you can easily proxy
connections (as you have access to the secret keys on the server)
and thus decrypt the attackers SSH session and monitor what is
going on. dsniff is not capable of dealing with all version of
the SSH protocol however, so forcing only protocol 1 support on
the server can solve this, in your sshd_config file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Protocol 1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>is specified and not:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Protocol 2,1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>dsniff is available from: <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/">http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/</a>

<h2><a name="Account lockout">Account lockout</a></h2>
<p>OpenBSD supports account lockouts using a variety of methods.
You can set the user's shell to a non existent shell such as
/bin/false (check /etc/shells first however), most daemons will
honor this and refuse to let the user log in. Alternatively
setting user login restrictions in /etc/login.conf can be used to
restrict a user's access. Unfortunately there is no easy way to
institute a user account lockout policy based on bad login
attempts, and due to the nature of most OpenBSD machines this is
largely unnecessary. OpenBSD enfoces strong passwords by default,
and because most OpenBSD machines are on public networks it would
be trivial for an attacker to abuse an automated account lockout
policy, denying legitimate users access to the server. </p>
