<p>Please note: these are advanced filesystem management tricks.
You may break things. You may break your system. These tricks
(usually) work on my test systems (please note I mostly test this
under VMWare so that I can &quot;refresh&quot; the OS quickly if
it does break horribly, this will not be so easy on a real
system). </p>

<h2>Making /etc a separate partition</h2>
<p>This is a question I've seen quite a few times, it's
dangerous, but useful. You can't make /etc a separate partition
with setting things up first, for one thing when the system boots
there won't be an /etc/fstab to read and figure out how to mount
anything. This means that portions of /etc must exist at boot
time. The trick is, on most UNIX systems, you can mount a
partition over a non-empty directory. This means that by leaving
a &quot;stub&quot; /etc partition containing the necessary boot
files you can easily boot the system and then have it mount a
different partition onto /etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reasons for doing this are numerous, for one thing you
could conceivably mount your /etc over NFS, although what
circumstances would lead to this are beyond my imagination. A
more common reason is out of security concerns, by mounting /etc
as a partition you can prevent hard links to files in /etc, you
can mount it read only (although you will be unable to change
system configuration or user passwords unless you remount the
partition writeable), and so on. Mounting /etc as a ramdisk is
another conceivable desire, this would speed up access, however
is lookups of usernames/etc are an issue you may consider running
something like the name service cache daemon. </p>
<p>For this example the stub /etc/ resides on /dev/wd0a, and the
/etc partition we wish to mount is on /dev/wd0d. </p>
<p>Step one is making sure you have enough files in the stub /etc
to run the system, this is pretty easy, simply leaving all the
files in there from the installation will typically do. The next
step is to create and format a different partition, such as
&quot;/dev/wd0d&quot;, it need not be very large, a few megabytes
will suffice. Backup the stub /etc using tar, make sure you
preserve file permissions and symbolic links:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># <strong>cd /etc</strong>
# <strong>tar -cvpf /etc.tar *</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now mount the partition you wish to host /etc on in a
different directory and untar the files onto it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># <strong>mount /etc2</strong>
# <strong>cd /etc2</strong>
# <strong>tar -xvf /etc.tar</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now simply modify the fstab file in the stub /etc directory on
/dev/wd0a so that it mounts /dev/wd0d as /etc:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/dev/wd0d /etc ffs rw 1 2</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can now manually mount /etc. or simply reboot the system
for the changes to take effect.</p>
<p>Of course this creates a new problem, how do you access the
stub partition? Unmounting the /dev/wd0d /etc to access /etc on
/dev/wd0a is one option, but things may break since files are
suddenly missing or changes such as adding users are no longer
there. One solution is to simply create a directory such as
/etc-real and in it create hard links to the files in the stub
/etc, since hard links point to the file inode even if the
&quot;real&quot; files are inaccessible you can access them via
the hard links. </p>
