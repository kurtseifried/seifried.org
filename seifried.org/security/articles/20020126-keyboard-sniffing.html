<p>Keyboard is a useful techniques for computer investigators,
forensics specialists and people who are overly curious in their
surroundings. Many modern security practices, such as encryption,
are virtually impossible to brute force, and if the defender is
using a good passphrase then it is virtually impossible to hit
the right combination unless you are very lucky. The answer to
this, and other password protected services is of course to use a
keyboard sniffer, in effect tricking the subject into revealing
their password. </p>
<p>There are two approaches to keyboard sniffing, the first being
hardware based and the second being software based. The advantage
of hardware sniffing is that it is unlikely that any software
will be able to detect it, and installation does not require
access to the operating system on the machine. The majority of
hardware sniffing devices are external, with items like the
keyghost consisting of a PS/2 extensions cable. Other devices
include an IOGear USB hub that is capable of logging keystrokes.
The downside is that any users who is security conscious and
regularly checks their machine for anomalous pieces of hardware
may find it. The other downside is you must physically visit the
machine in most cases to retrieve the data that has been logged
which can add additional risk. Hardware devices also tend to work
poorly with laptops as few people use external keyboards. </p>
<p>The other choice is software based. These require access to
the operating system as you must install software with
administrative privileges (which you may not have if doing an
investigation/etc). The upside of these is that few users will
detect it, and many software packages can be configured to
automatically send out the keystrokes, reducing the risk
associated with retrieving the data.There are numerous
&quot;legitimate&quot; packages for Windows that will allow you
to sniff keyboard activity and some even include features such as
taking screen snapshots to monitor activity. For Unix systems you
will generally need to find a kernel modules, or a patch for the
user's login shell (which can usually be changed), generally
speaking the kernel option is more reliable. Several rootkits
exist for Windows and Unix that have keyboard sniffing
capabilities, a few are listed below and the rest can be
discovered on google. </p>
