<p>This article has been updated on October 24th. I love it when
I get to write a happy ending. See section marked
&quot;Update&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On October 23rd as I was downloading Red Hat 7.2 release I
noticed something strange. While idly checking the package
signatures on the files I had two of them weren't signed
correctly. At first I thought it might be an issue in GnuPG or
rpm, so I ran all the Red Hat 7.1 files through an &quot;rpm
-K&quot; and examined the output. Everything there worked fine
(as it always has). But when I tried it on the 7.2 files the same
error came up (edited for brevity):</p>

<p>Huh. redhat-release and rpmdb-redhat are not signed correctly?
Has distro.ibiblio.org been broken into? So I downloaded those
files from another server. Same result. </p>
<p>No I start to seriously wonder what is going. Have several ftp
servers been broken into, and the files replaced? This seems
rather unlikely since every server I checked it was the same,
only rpmdb-redhat and redhat-release were not properly signed.
This leaves three other possible causes, both undesirable. The
first is that someone managed to subvert the process by which
mirror sites get files from Red Hat. Via DNS poisoning perhaps,
or breaking into the Red Hat distribution server. This is exactly
the kind of attack that proper cryptographic signing of packages
will defeat however. Even if the attacker pulls of a perfect
attack, switches the packages around, and leaves without a trace
any end users that tries to verify the package signatures will
very quickly find out these are not the original packages that
were issued by the vendor. The other option is that Red Hat had a
failure in it's security process somewhere, and the packages were
not signed, managed to slip through quality control, and were
released to the public. Both would indicate a major failure in
the security process and practices of Red Hat as a company and be
cause for concern by any customer. To make a bad analogy: would
you buy a new car if you noticed pieces were missing? </p>
<p>The third option is what worries me the most. Red Hat made a
conscious decision not to sign these packages. The actual reason
for this escapes me. These packages were signed in the Red Hat
7.1 file distribution (contrary to what Marty Wesley Red Hat OS
Product Manager is quoted as saying in an email forwarded to me
by Brian McWilliams, a reporter for NewsBytes) [minor spell check
fixes]:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>While security should always be an important concern, this is not a
security problem. These two packages are not signed and have not been
signed since they existed. Contrary to the report, these
packages were not signed for RHL7.1 either.

rpmdb-redhat = This is a database listing of files included with the Red
Hat distribution. Think of it like an index. It is simply an
informational database, thus the worst any attacker could do is change
the information in the database so that every time a customer performed
an inquiry it replied with an erroneous message.

redhat-release = This is the package that identifies the system as Red
Hat Linux 7.2 (Enigma) when you login. The worst case for us is if this
package is changed, it break Red Hat Network as it uses this file to
determine what version of Red Hat they are using.

As far as the part of the report that addresses exploits when running as
root,
You have to be root to install packages, so this isn't an exploit.
If someone wants to modify software on a machine and they have root
access, there
are far easier ways to cause damage (like deleting every file on
the machine). Why bother installing a bogus rpm?

Marty</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several significant problems and completely
incorrect statements in this message. The first of course is that
the packages have never been signed since they existed (perhaps
he means Red Hat 7.2 betas and not 7.1 and before). The second
major problem is the statement &quot;thus the worst any attacker
could do is change the information in the database so that every
time a customer performed an inquiry it replied with an erroneous
message.&quot;. This is completely untrue. An attacker could
easily add a file to the rpm package that creates a backdoor,
installs Trojan software, adds user accounts, or any other number
of possibilities. The other attack would be to add a script to
the package, this script could add users and groups, create
backdoors using installed software like telnet, ssh, bash or
login, or could even call rpm to install packages from remote
sites. The same goes for the statement about redhat-release. The
last section is completely wrong as Marty misses the point of the
advisory entirely. The attacker doesn't need root access on your
system. He simply needs the subvert the files you are installing
from, for example by breaking into an ftp server, or poisoning
your DNS cache so that you are redirected to the attackers site
instead of a legitimate site. Even if you take the time and care
to verify the files signatures you are left with two unsigned
packages that cannot be verified. The MD5 sums of the packages
are not available in any trusted locations (i.e. Red Hat
website), so they cannot be easily used to verify integrity. So
what is the user to do? Modify the default install so they do not
install these packages (redhat-release is most often installed by
default). </p>
<p>Ultimately this practice is extremely dangerous for one simple
reason. Cryptographic signing of rpm packages is the primary
defense against attackers modifying these packages before you
install them. By not signing some packages Red Hat has started
the training process that will result in people routinely
installing RPM packages that are not correctly signed, such as
security updates. This is completely unacceptable. This problem
will continue until Red Hat (like most other vendors) religiously
signs all packages and encourages end users to check these
signatures. Several vendors have already taken this step, making
the default in update software to check the signature and reject
the upgrade package if it is not signed properly. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>Well Red Hat has emailed me, and to quote Preston Borwn in two
seperate emails:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>We have now signed them.&nbsp; Our MD5SUM files for the ISO images are now
signed as well with our GPG key, to allay any potential fears of mischief.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>We will sign these packages going forward.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes me very happy and is the right thing to do.
Hopefully other vendors will learn from this and not repeat the
mistakes made by Red Hat, but if they do hoepfully they will
respond as quickly, and ultimately as correctly as Red Hat has. </p>
