<p>The following are my predictions for information security in
2002:</p>
<h2>Technical:</h2>
<p>Wireless networks will remain insecure. WEP is totally
insecure, the replacements proposed for it have been found flawed
even before they are deployed. What is needed is good old
fashioned IPSec between clients, and clients and the gateway.
This of course requires a lot of effort and is simply not
possible on many wireless devices. Even if these problems were
solved tomorrow there will still be thousands upon thousands of
insecure wireless networks for attackers to exploit. </p>
<p>MS's security effort will not accomplish much, other then
patching a few more holes. The code has been written, in huge
volumes, fixing it is a Herculean task. Their claims that buffer
overflows had been eradicated from XP are patently absurd, as we
all know holes like the UPnP bug were found quite quickly, and
there are more where that came from. </p>
<p>Linux security is getting better, with the addition of LSM the
kernel will provide a robust security facility. For those that
use it, and configure their policies correctly, and maintain them
(in other words not to many people). Add on software will
continue to have holes, especially the plethora of small projects
hosted at SourceForge and run by people with no idea of
programming securely let alone designing secure software. </p>
<p>FreeBSD and NetBSD will lurch along similarly to Linux, there
will be bugs found, exploited and patched. </p>
<p>OpenBSD will continue to proactively audit, we'll see 20 or so
security fixes announced, mostly in the &quot;probably not
exploitable but just in case&quot; and &quot;not by default&quot;
category. </p>
<p>OpenSSH will continue to pummel commercial ssh (which has
moved onwards to VPN's in any event) in the Unix market, all
that's really missing is an easy chroot widget for sftp.</p>
<p>Apache will hopefully release 2.0 this year, I suspect there
is a nasty security bug lurking in the code, but hopefully I'm
wrong. People will do incredibly strange things with the
framework provided like building telnet servers and ftp servers,
someone will build an ssh server, ultimately you will be able to
run all your services via apache, just like Emacs allows you to
edit and manage files, read mail and make cheese soufflé. </p>
<p>Software in general will still be a security disaster. No
amount of C#, .NET or tools will change the basic fact that
almost all programmers have no software security education or
expertise.</p>
<p>The volume of attacks, incidents, port scans and so on will
continue to rise. More and more people are getting high speed
Internet access, more servers are going online, access costs are
getting cheaper. You think it's bad now wait till all the male
teenagers in China and India have Internet access. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Economic</h2>
<p>Companies will spend more money on security for a number of
reasons:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Technicians and administrators will push for more money
under the guise of security. More money is always good.
Maybe it will get spent on security, maybe not.</li>
<li>Tax breaks for spending on security in the US have been
proposed. Thus I won't upgrade to Win2k because MS is
gonna ream me either way, but because I need to replace
these NT machines with a more secure solution.</li>
<li>Security is hip, and the market has literally exploded
with products and services, many companies are selling
hard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies will spend more money in security incidents; clean
up costs will rise for the simple fact that companies will
actually be cleaning things up rather then ignoring them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Policy</h2>
<p>More security laws will be proposed and passed, things like
the DMCA are just to nice for most companies to pass up (they get
a lot without giving much of anything up).</p>
<p>People will cotton on to the fact that terrorists don't need
fancy peer to peer encrypted hidden networks. SSL web mail is all
you need to communicate relatively securely (hint: HotMail).
People will undoubtedly propose tough monitoring and restrictions
on public Internet access points such as web cafe's and
libraries. </p>
