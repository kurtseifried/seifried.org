<td><b>February 14, 2001 - </b>Yesterday it became public
knowledge that Tatu Ylonen, the creator of the SSH
protocol and founder of a company with the same name,
asked the OpenSSH group to change its name. Normally such
a case, a commercial company asking someone to change its
name, wouldn't be a terribly big deal &#151; but in this
case it is. SSH was first used as the name for a
protocol, &quot;Secure SHell.&quot; The SSH protocol uses
strong crypto and public key cryptography and provides a
secure replacement for insecure protocols such as Telnet,
rexec, rcp, rsh, FTP and so on. In addition, the SSH
protocol features tunneling, allowing you to easily wrap
insecure protocols such as POP or X and face far fewer
worries when using them. <p>The history of the SSH
protocol is long and checkered. Originally, around July
of 1995 Tatu Ylonen released the first version. Just over
half a year later version 1.2.13 was released. 1.2.13 was
a major release. It signaled the start of a new era, with
SSH Communications signing agreements with F-Secure.
Interestingly enough, at that time versions 1.2.0 to
1.2.12 were removed from the FTP site (and since then
copies have been very hard to find). </p>
<p>The original licenses (they change over time) on
Tatu's SSH software allowed for modification and
distribution of the code. As time went on, however, the
license on SSH become increasingly restrictive, with a
fully commercial license in version 1.2.28, by which time
SSH had become a very popular standard. </p>
<p>Enter OpenSSH. Created as a free alternative to SSH
Communications' product, the OpenBSD team forked an
earlier version of Tatu's SSH code, which had a less
restrictive license than later versions. OpenSSH's source
code was tidied up and then released, and protocol 2
support was added in, making it fully compatible with the
commercial SSH implementation. </p>
<p>More recently, the IETF (Internet Engineering Task
Force) has been working on making the SSH protocol a
standard. During the latter parts of this process SSH
Communications has begun trying to enforce the term
&quot;SSH&quot; as a trademark it claims to own.</p>
<p>This is where things get messy. For SSH Communications
to claim that &quot;SSH&quot; is a trademark, they must
meet several conditions. The most obvious is that they
must register &quot;SSH&quot; as a trademark; this has
been done. </p>
<p>Secondly, they must defend their trademark, and as far
as I know this is the first time they have chosen to
enforce their trademark. After several years of no
enforcement, several dozen software packages exist that
use the word &quot;SSH&quot; in their titles.
Additionally, SSH Communications has contacted only the
OpenSSH project; the only other contact was an attempt to
send an email to Bugtraq regarding ScanSSH's use of the
word SSH, sent by Tatu Ylonen (which is odd, since the
contact information for the authors of ScanSSH is not
hard to find). </p>
<p>Also, various rights were granted in earlier versions
of Tatu's SSH license, and once rights are granted they
cannot be taken away. (There are other issues with the
license as well, regarding the use of GPL code, for
example.) All in all this is a very messy situation. </p>
<p>Tatu Ylonen of SSH Communications seems to want his
major competitor, OpenSSH, to change its name and stop
using the word &quot;SSH.&quot; He also has written that
he is willing to grant the IETF usage of the trademark
&quot;SSH,&quot; but will later revoke that permission.
The complete non-enforcement of the &quot;SSH&quot;
trademark for several years, followed by extremely
selective enforcement (OpenSSH.com was contacted, while
OpenSSH.org was not) seems rather strange until you
consider several facts:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The SSH protocol is about to become an official
Internet standard. It is already hugely popular
and important. (Theo de Raadt rates the three
most important protocols on the Internet as BGP,
DNS and SSH.)</li>
<li>Despite commercial SSH products being
&quot;free&quot; for Linux and Free/Net/OpenBSD
users, there are no Linux/BSD vendors shipping
Commercial SSH with their operating systems. In
fact, the vast majority have chosen OpenSSH (with
one minor exception using older versions of
Tatu's SSH that are still free).</li>
<li>The stock price of F-Secure (distributor for SSH)
has tumbled 90% in the last few months. SSH
Communications' stock price, since going public
in December of 2000, has fallen 50%. </li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the actual registered trademark at <a href="http://tess.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=muin9a.3.1">http://tess.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=muin9a.3.1</a>
and <a href="http://tess.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=muin9a.3.2">http://tess.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=muin9a.3.2</a>
seems to cover only the logo itself. In any event,
Fairchild Industries, Inc. seems to think it owns the
trademark already. </p>
<p>I managed to interview three of the principal people
involved in this: Tatu Ylonen (SSH Communications), Theo
de Raadt (OpenBSD/OpenSSH) and Bill Sommerfeld (IETF SSH
working group). Interviews were done via email. Hopefully
this dispute will be resolved. To quote Bill Sommerfeld:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, added delay in the standards
process does not help the end user.</p>

<h2>SSH Communications</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried: </b>What prompted you to write
SSH originally?</p>
<p><b>Tatu Ylonen: </b>There was a hacker attack at
the university network in Finland. It was a password
sniffing attack, and when it was discovered, the
attacker had several thousand username-password pairs
in its database, including some from my company at
the time.</p>
<p>I basically wanted to build something that I can
use to log into my company's and university servers
without having to worry about someone stealing my
password. I also wanted to advance the widespread
deployment of strong cryptography, because I think it
is important both from a network security standpoint
and for the stability of the society at large, since
the networks are very much the backbone that the
information society build on. They must be secure. </p>
<p>The software filled a wide need that was just
beginning to be recognized. It did the right thing at
the right time, and for the first time made
encrypting login sessions easy for the users. I
released the first version in July 1995, and started
SSH Communications Security Corp when I could no
longer deal with the support requests I was receiving
(150 mails per day by the end of 1995).</p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried: </b>Why are you asking OpenSSH
to change the name of their project?</p>
<p><b>Tatu Ylonen: </b>Because their product name and
their unauthorized use of the SSH trademark has
caused significant confusion as to the meaning and
origin of the SSH brand. I've also received quite a
few e-mails where people have confused OpenSSH as my
product.</p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried:</b> What is the best thing about
SSH currently? What is the worst?</p>
<p><b>Tatu Ylonen: </b>I think one of the cooler
things with SSH Secure Shell is the fully integrated
secure file transfers that you get on Windows with
SSH Secure Shell for Workstations (evaluation version
available <a href="ftp://ftp.ssh.com/pub/ssh">ftp://ftp.ssh.com/pub/ssh</a>).
It makes using corporate files from one's laptop
extremely easy, even for novice users who have never
used a Unix machine. I think it is very important to
make things easy for users, so that they get widely
deployed.</p>
<p>I guess this trademark incident is the worst. We
have no other alternative but to protect the
trademark. For this reason, I've asked the OpenSSH
group to please change the name of their product. Our
trademark policy has been well known to them for a
long time, e.g. through the IETF working group.</p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried:</b> If you could do three things
to SSH, ignoring backward compatibility, etc., what
would they be?</p>
<p><b>Tatu Ylonen: </b>I'm quite happy with version 2
of the protocol. The version 1 protocol is flawed (it
doesn't properly authenticate the key exchange, and
additionally it uses message authentication code that
is cryptographically way too weak). These bugs open
an endless stream of possible security flaws, which
we will undoubtedly see emerging time after time in
the public. If I could change one thing, it would be
the version 1 key exchange. On the other hand, it is
already solved in the version 2 protocol.</p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried:</b> Why do you think SSH
Protocol 1 should be depreciated? All the attacks
listed at your site (<a href="http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/cert/vulnerability.html">http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/cert/vulnerability.html</a>)
involve either encryption being turned off, or the
use of RC4.</p>
<p><b>Tatu Ylonen: </b>All of these problems are just
individual symptoms of a much deeper, fundamental
problem in the protocol, which we will encounter time
after time as people find ways to circumvent the
kludges that are being used to work around previous
instances of the problem. </p>

<h2>OpenSSH</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried: </b>What prompted you to start
the OpenSSH project originally?</p>
<p><b>Theo de Raadt: </b>I think that after BGP and
DNS, the SSH protocol is the most important thing
that people need to maintain reliability of the
internet. Since a free one did not exist, we started
[our] project as soon as we found out about the
licensing terms on ssh-1.2.12. These terms permitted
completely free use of the software, and the names
&quot;ssh&quot; and &quot;Secure Shell&quot; as long
as the protocol matched the supplied RFC document. So
we maintained compatibility. </p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried: </b>About how many people are
working on the OpenSSH project (full- or part-time)?</p>
<p><b>Theo de Raadt: </b>Open source developers are
funny; they work harder part-time than most people
work full-time. I think that there are perhaps 5
really serious OpenSSH developers. By far, the most
serious one is Markus Friedl.</p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried:</b> Why do you think you are now
being asked to change the name of the project?</p>
<p><b>Theo de Raadt: </b>Probably because ssh.com
sees us as competition and wants to create confusion.</p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried:</b> What is the best thing about
SSH/OpenSSH currently? What is the worst?</p>
<p><b>Theo de Raadt: </b>The best thing is that it
can be freely incorporated in any system anyone wants
to. Any operating system group, vendor of a switch or
router, of a firewall appliance, can just pop it in
and have a secure channel into their product. The
security of our international network infrastructure
is going to happen because they can add secure
network connection technology to it for $0.</p>
<p>Since it is free, there is no worst. If you don't
like it, you are free to use something else!</p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried:</b> Do you think the SSH 1
protocol should be depreciated? All the attacks
listed at your site (<a href="http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/cert/vulnerability.html">http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/cert/vulnerability.html</a>)
either involve encryption being turned off, or the
use of RC4.</p>
<p><b>Theo de Raadt: </b>Most of those issues listed
are old attacks, predating all but the most aged SSH
protocol users. More recently, we have encouraged
groups such as CORE-SDI to find new flaws (I visited
Buenos Aires and dared them to find something). Some
other implementation flaws have also come to light,
and luckily we already had them fixed. Honestly,
there are some other theoretical attacks against SSH1
protocol (and to some extent against SSH2 protocol as
well), but we will continue [work] on repairing them.
Note that SSH1-only servers account for 70% of all
servers. Of the remaining, roughly 8% do SSH2
protocol only. For now, supporting both makes sense,
supporting only protocol 1 is future-insensitive, but
supporting only protocol 2 is stupid. I think that
ssh.com wants SSH1 protocol dead because it makes
them no money.</p>
<p><a href="http://ssh-research.ucs.ualberta.ca/ssh-stats.html">http://ssh-research.ucs.ualberta.ca/ssh-stats.html</a></p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried: </b>According to <a href="http://www.ssh.com/about/press/2000/release15082000.html">http://www.ssh.com/about/press/2000/release15082000.html</a>:
&quot;Users of Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD
operating systems may now use SSH Secure Shell 2.3
free of charge, regardless of use.&quot; Also,
developers (vendors) such as Red Hat, FreeBSD, etc.
can ship commercial SSH with their distributions, and
the license for 2.3 allows much greater
non-commercial use and single-user usage. As far as I
know, none of these vendors ship commercial SSH with
their operating systems. Why do you think this is?</p>
<p><b>Theo de Raadt: </b>They choose OpenSSH because
it is a 100%-equivalent solution which supports both
SSH1 and SSH2, and it is completely free. I think
this is something which the Open Source community
understands well enough that I don't need to explain
it.</p>

<h2>IETF</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried: </b>Why do you (IETF) feel that
the SSH protocol is so important?</p>
<p><b>Bill Sommerfeld:</b> The original ssh1 protocol
is widely used as an alternative to flagrantly
insecure protocols and as such is a major
improvement; however, it has a number of significant
cryptographic flaws which are addressed in the
protocol being developed by the IETF's Secure Shell
working group.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/161150">http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/161150</a>
(one which was recently announced).</p>
<p>Also, the use of CRC32 for an
&quot;authentication&quot; check is also highly
suspect; the 'crc compensation attack detector' is at
best a bandaid for the problem.</p>
<p><b>Kurt Seifried:</b> Do you (IETF) worry about a
vendor controlling part of the standards process so
directly? (That is, SSH granting the use of the word
SSH to the IETF under certain conditions?)</p>
<p><b>Bill Sommerfeld: </b>The IETF has standardized
protocols with trademarked names in the past.
Kerberos (rfc1510) is a trademark of MIT, and PGP
(rfc2440 among others) is a trademark of NAI. IETF
working groups have also renamed protocols to avoid
trademark issues. S/Key was standardized as
&quot;OTP&quot; to avoid conflict with the Bellcore
trademark on the original implementation (see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/otp-charter.html">http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/otp-charter.html</a>).</p>
<p><b>Bill Sommerfeld: </b>The IETF as a whole does
not take a position on the validity of intellectual
property claims -- see RFC2026, &quot;The Internet
Standards Process&quot; (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt</a>),
and the IETF's page of IPR notices (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/ipr.html">http://www.ietf.org/ipr.html</a>).
</p>
<p>The IETF has dozens of working groups. One of them
is the Secure Shell (SECSH) working group, which was
chartered in 1997 or so to define an internet
standard based on Tatu Ylonen's SSH. (As an aside,
the working group wasn't given the &quot;SSH&quot;
abbreviation because, at the time, the IETF already
had a &quot;Site Security Handbook&quot; working
group which had grabbed the SSH abbreviation. Had the
other SSH not been there, the working group would
have been abbreviated as &quot;SSH&quot;.) </p>
<p>The original working group chair stepped down over
the summer, and I was asked to take over as working
group chair at that time. Since then the working
group has been making steady progress and we appeared
to be very close to getting a set of documents ready
to hand up to the IESG for review -- we were in the
middle of the working group's &quot;Last Call&quot;
period on the core Secure Shell protocol documents
when I first received word of the dispute.</p>
<p>In practice, IETF working groups tend to
&quot;engineer around&quot; troublesome IPR issues;
for instance, the SSH version 2 protocol was changed
to use DSS instead of RSA to avoid the (now expired)
RSA patent. I can't predict how the working group
will react to this -- I only know that it will slow
things down. </p>
