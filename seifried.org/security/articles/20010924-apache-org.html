<p>As you've probably heard by now, Apache.org was broken into
last week, and the system was compromised. How this happened is
much more interesting then your usual &quot;known hole in an old
piece of software&quot; scenario (although this was the final
nail in the coffin for Apache.org).</p>
<p>Most break-ins we hear about are relatively straightforward --
someone was running an unpatched copy of IIS 5.0 or they forgot
to upgrade their FTP server to a recent version. These types of
problems are relatively easy to deal with, you keep software up
to date, but they are impossible to completely eliminate. At some
point you have to run software to make the system useful, and
even the most heavily audited and secured system will have bugs
in it's software. It is inevitable that at some point an attacker
will discover a problem and use it, or release code publicly
allowing anyone to exploit the flaw, and software vendors will
react, provide a fix, but this still needs to be applied by
system administrators.</p>
<p>However, an old issue is becoming increasingly problematic as
more machines are placed online. The problem is trust.</p>
<h2>What is trust?</h2>
<p>From <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/">dictionary.com</a>
we get several definitions for &quot;trust&quot;, depending on
usage, but the one I will be dealing with primarily is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firm reliance on the integrity, ability, or character of a
person or thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of this would be developers logging into the
primary Apache.org development machine from remote locations. The
SSH protocol is used to secure these connections with strong
encryption, which provides a tunnel between the two communicating
machines. Furthermore, it is assumed that the end developer's
machine is secure, and that there are no keystroke loggers
running, or items like KeyGhost hooked up to the machine. Herein
lies a problem. More and more people are using machines that are
not always secure or should not be considered
&quot;trusted&quot;. </p>
<h2>Where's the beef?</h2>
<p>The number of publicly available terminals in libraries,
educational computer labs, cafe's and other places has exploded
in the last few years. The vast majority of these machines are
not very well secured, ranging from Linux machines in a private
cubicle (where LILO was not locked down) to windows machines that
will cheerfully boot from a floppy disk.</p>
<p>While breaking into these systems and logging passwords is
probably not going to help you break into a specific site, if you
throw out a large enough net you will catch something of interest
eventually. This is especially true for more populous systems
such as ISP shell servers and university servers (which are
notorious for being poorly secured). Once you have a shell
account on a system it becomes much easier to exploit any
security flaws, local or remote.</p>
<p>The number of passwords being entered into insecure machines
and sent to insecure machines will only continue to grow, and
once an attacker gains administrative or root access on a machine
it is trivial to log all passwords (using modified versions of
ssh clients and daemons for example). Harvesting passwords in
this manner is relatively easy (choose poorly secured and
maintained systems in a foreign country) and it only gets easier
with time, since many people have a tendency to use the same
password for multiple systems.</p>
<p>If you see someone logging into a server with the password
&quot;NBd72ts&quot; chances are probably good that it's the same
password to log into the machine they came from. This process can
even be automated by a savvy attacker -- software loads onto a
system, breaks root with any number of well known local exploits,
then attempts to connect back to machines people log in from,
using their passwords, breaks root with any number of well known
local exploits, and so on and so forth. Sending passwords back to
it's master is not to hard either, by encrypting them and posting
them to newsgroups, public mailing lists, online website and so
forth where the attacker can easily collect them anonymously. </p>
<h3>So what exactly happened to Apache.org?</h3>
<p>An attacker &quot;broke in&quot; using a developer's password
and then managed to exploit a security hole in the SSH server
that had accidentally gone unfixed (the administrator had created
new SSH binaries but failed to install them properly). This
developer's password was harvested from SourceForge, which the
attacker had broken into. So there were three main elements that
contributed to the incident:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Reliance on shell accounts.</li>
<li>Developer logging in from a system outside their control.</li>
<li>Failed upgrade procedure -- there were no checks to
ensure that the update had &quot;taken&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>And several lesser elements:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use of passwords instead of one-time password or
smartcard based systems. Usage of public/private key
login for SSH is also recommended (but probably would not
have helped in this incident)</li>
<li>Multiple services running on a single server, increasing
the chances for finding an exploitable vulnerability
(although in this case it was SSH which has to be run on
virtually every system providing shell access).</li>
<li>Lack of chroot or jail'ing of interactive shell sessions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interview with Brian Behlndorf</h2>
<p>Brian is President of the Apache Software Foundation, and
responsible for the infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt: </strong>Do you currently have guidelines, or
plan to implement any, with respect to security on developer
machines? For example TAMU used to require people to run cops and
pass all its checks before they would allow machines to go
online.</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>Since we only have one box (today),
the guidelines have always been &quot;do what you can to keep it
secure&quot; -- and nothing more formal.&nbsp; The default
FreeBSD security auditing programs have been pretty successful in
detecting hacks; there is always more we can do, though.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt:</strong> And what about the workstations and
systems used by developers on their end?</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>Nope, no standards; we trust people to
do the Right Thing, but now are getting large enough that
defining that might be worthwhile.&nbsp; Someone is working on a
security standards for developers document, this should probably
be added.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt:</strong> What is/are the biggest problem(s) with
removing people's shell access to the servers, what solutions are
being implemented or looked at?</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>It's simply that so many of the tools
we use today presume shell access is easy to give, and are thus
designed to work best with it.&nbsp; For example, CVS, updating
web pages, and managing mailing lists, all (at this point) are
all managed by editing files locally.&nbsp; There are non-shell
solutions to each, but getting them all to work together
consistently (so you have one view of who a developer is, etc) is
a huge challenge - one my company has been focusing on with our
Tigris project (<a href="http://www.tigris.org">www.tigris.org</a>).&nbsp;
I'd say of all of them CVS is probably the biggest pain, but
there are solutions. </p>
<p><strong>Kurt:</strong> Are you considering the use of one time
passwords, tokens or smartcards for shell access to the server?</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>Have not considered that, but
could.&nbsp; In fact that would even make logging in from
keystroke-capturing cybercafes safe, wouldn't it?&nbsp; Good
idea. Wish there was a way to make it optional, though making it
optional is probably missing the point.</p>
<p>I guess this is the eternal struggle between ease of use and
security; sometimes we lean too far towards the ease-of-use side,
and get burned. There's also the cost-to-admin issue - since all
resources available to Apache are donations of time and effort,
the simplest solution is usually the one taken.&nbsp; Again, not
always the wisest choice.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt:</strong> With the increase in public and
semi-public systems (like SourceForge and ISP servers) do you
think there will be more attacks like this one?</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>If I were a cracker and had gotten
root on a box, I'd certainly want to be able to get root on more,
and compromising sshd &amp; ssh is probably the best way to at
least get a shell these days, and usually from a shell there's at
least one or two root compromises available.&nbsp; So yeah, this
is probably going to increase (we'll probably be dealing with the
aftereffects of all those hacked passwords for awhile anyways),
and finding ways to avoid needing shells (or better containing
people who use shells, e.g. using jails or capabilities) is
probably going to be a pretty fruitful area of security research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>What's the Solution?</h2>
<p>The most obvious solution would be to remove shell access
where possible, so that even if an attacker manages to grab a
password, exploiting the system is much more difficult.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is the only easy answer, and not available
to everyone. If you must provide shell access (because you are
selling it, for example) the best thing to do would be to lock
down the system as much as possible, removing as many setuid and
setgid binaries is a good start. Restricting what users can do
through a restrictive shell, chroot'ing, subdomain, tight file
permissions and so forth is also recommended and can limit any
damage. Programs like tripwire can monitor binaries such as ssh
and sshd, so if an attacker replaces them with trojan'ed versions
you will hopefully be notified promptly assuming of course the
attacker doesn't intercept the alert and quash it. Of course you
need to pay attention to your alerts and act upon them quickly
otherwise they will do no good. Reducing the reliance upon
passwords will also help, however most solutions such as tokens,
smartcards, biometric authentication and so on tend to be
relatively expensive. As long as people can remotely access a
system without restrictions (such as using tcp_wrappers to
restrict which IP's and domains they can log in from) you
essentially trust every machine on the Internet. </p>
