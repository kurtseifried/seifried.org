<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cindy looks up from her book and stares at the screen for a
bit, watching EasyRecover chew through Jeff's hard drive and
rebuild files. Yawning, she looks at the clock and has to wonder
how much longer it will take. She gets up and leaves her office,
locking the door behind herself. </p>

<td>In the process of evidence gathering, it's a bad idea
to leave anything unattended. This can break the chain of
evidence, rendering it useless for a court of law. Of
course, by working on the original media Cindy has
already violated this principle, since she is modifying
the original evidence. </td>

</table>
<p>Wandering towards the cafeteria, she wonders what was on
Jeff's hard drive. Hopefully the video capture board in Jeff's
machine was there for a certain reason. . . . She sits down with
her coffee and glances around. Where is everyone at 5 a.m.? </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Andy glances up from his monitor and blinks a few times.
Tapping the keyboard cautiously, he peers at the results on his
monitor. A few more cautious taps, a deep breath. Hitting Print,
he anxiously waits for the page to come out before grabbing it
and sprinting down the hall to Cindy's office. Grasping at the
doorknob he bounces off the door as it fails to open inward. He
peers through the window. Cindy is gone, but her computer is
still on. Spinning around, he starts running towards the
cafeteria.</p>
<p>&quot;Andy, you ok?&quot; asks Cindy, gently helping Andy off
of the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;I, me. . . log. . . thingy. . . Jeff!&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy stares at Andy. Has he hit his head hard enough to do
permanent damage?</p>
<p>&quot;Jeff. . . server. . . printed!&quot; Flopping over, Andy
scrambles for a sheet of paper on the floor and thrusts it in
Cindy's direction.</p>

</table>
<p>&quot;This can't be right, are you sure?&quot;</p>
<p>Andy nods his head and flops onto a chair.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm calling the police now. You should get some ice for
that bruise.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy heads for her office, relieved to find the door still
locked and the computer still working on Jeff's files.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Detective Bayliss?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is Cindy, down at ACME Corp. I think I may have
found some new evidence. Could you and your partner please come
down?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of evidence?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd rather not say over an open phone line.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>An hour later a dusty white Cavalier pulls up. The two
detectives emerge hastily and enter the building. After taking a
few wrong turns they finally end up at Cindy's office. Knocking,
Bayliss opens the door to discover Cindy wiping her eyes with a
Kleenex. Startled, she composes herself and wipes the last tear
away.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, hello detective. I think I found out what
happened.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahh, that's good &#151; what do you think
happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, why don't I let you watch for yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>Bayliss glances at Pembleton and nods at Cindy. Hitting Enter,
Cindy restarts the slide show on the computer.</p>
<p>&quot;I found a work order. Jeff had a cable run from the
server room camera to his office. He had it hooked up to his
computer, and it stored an image once per second of the video
surveillance. Now the attacker deleted all the files on Jeff's
computer, but I managed to recover them, and found this.&quot;</p>
<p>She points at the screen and taps the bottom righthand corner,
at the time index. &quot;It goes from Friday, for several days up
until. . . until his death.&quot;</p>
<p>Advancing the slideshow several days, she pauses before taking
a deep breath and advancing it up several more hours.</p>
<p>&quot;You can see what happens next. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>With morbid fascination Bayliss and Pembleton observe the
stop-motion film of a short figure clad in black enter the room.
Heading directly for the main tape cabinet, the intruder starts
to pry the door open. After a few moments the figure wedges the
crowbar between the tape cabinet and the wall, trying to move the
cabinet out a bit to get a better purchase on the hinges. The
figure appears frustrated, taking a few swings at the cabinet,
apparently trying to knock the hinges off. </p>
<p>Another figure enters the room &#151; Jeff. Standing between
the intruder and the tape cabinet, he appears to be talking. The
intruder takes a swing at Jeff and the hood falls backwards.</p>
<p>Cindy pauses the replay and takes a deep breath. &quot;That's
my niece, Samantha. I haven't seen her since before this, neither
has her mother. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>Starting the slideshow up again, Cindy leans back and shuts
her eyes. </p>
<p>Bayliss takes out a notepad and jots down a few details while
watching the screen. The intruder takes a swing at Jeff, hitting
him in the stomach. The next frame shows him falling backwards.
The next few frames are like something out of a horror film:
Samantha backing up with her mouth open and the deceptively slow
fall of the cabinet onto Jeff. </p>
<p>Samantha flees the room shortly after taking several tapes
from the cabinet. </p>
<p>&quot;Wow, looks like she killed him all right. I'd say that's
assault with intent to harm. Have you got a description of
her?&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy nods and hands him a piece of paper.</p>
<p>&quot;This photograph is current?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, look at that &#151;&quot;</p>
<p>Bayliss taps the screen as another figure moves into the
frame. &quot;Who's that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know &#151; I didn't watch this far the first
time.&quot;</p>
<p>Observing the second intruder, Cindy wonders how he manages to
shift the tape cabinet off of Jeff. She turns pale as Jeff's body
is dragged out of the room along with several tiles.</p>
<p>&quot;He must have then come into Jeff's office and deleted
the files. . . but who would do this?&quot; Cindy looks at
Bayliss and Pembleton for an answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he also knew Jeff's passcode, and which tapes to
take from the surveillance room. It looks like an inside job. You
gave us a list of all employees, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Do you want the fingerprints as well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn't you give that to us the first time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we try to protect the privacy of our employees. .
. .&quot;</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Pembleton wonders about the sanity of
certain ACME Corp employees. &quot;Those fingerprints would be
greatly appreciated. Is there anything else we should know?&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy blinks. &quot;Well, someone. . . that is, it looks like
Jeff logged in from a remote location. We tried to trace it back
but the system no longer exists. It was at the local
university.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you mean the intruder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it must have been Jeff. . . . Whoever logged in from
the remote location used a fingerprint scanner to get in.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Holy floppy disks, a doppelganger in disguise? Jeff's spirit
returned to haunt the IT department? A glitch in the logging
server? Stay tuned!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ford Pinto, destined to go down in history as one of the
world's most dangerous cars, could have been made relatively safe
with the addition of a $5 rubber bladder for the fuel tank. With
a rubber bladder, the gas tank would have been much less likely
to puncture during a rear-end collision and cause the Pinto to
burst into a fireball. Now in virtually every modern car there is
a rubber bladder in the fuel tank. </p>
<p>More or less identical situations happen all the time in
computer security. Protocols are unsecure because they lack a
simple authentication or encryption method. SNMP, for example,
has earned a reputation of being an extremely unsecure protocol.
If you read the history of SNMP, you will find that security was
supposed to be built in. However, the vendors never quite got
around to formalizing any standards regarding security. </p>

<p>A well-lit office, full of cubicles. Oddly enough, many of the
employees appear to be wearing sidearms, ranging from snubnose
revolvers to .45 caliber Glocks. A tired-looking Cindy walks in
behind Bayliss and Pembleton, a large carton in her arms full to
the brim with printouts and hard drives. Stopping at a rather
messy desk, Cindy sets the carton down on the floor. </p>
<p>&quot;Cindy, this is Officer Collier. He's in our technical
services branch.&quot;</p>
<p>Nodding, Officer Collier shakes Cindy's hand. &quot;This is
all the evidence, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes: Jeff's hard drive, the recreated data, printouts of
access logs, and the logs on tape backup.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK, and how did you recreate the data on Jeff's
drive?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I pulled his hard drive, put it in another machine and
ran a data recovery program.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Using Jeff's hard drive as the source? Or a copy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jeff's hard drive. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ermm. . . OK. . . we might not be able to use that in a
court of a law. For all we know, you created this footage to
exonerate your niece.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not! Besides, who accessed his account after he
disappeared?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe <i>you</i> did, to throw us off the trail.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that's impossible! Our new biometric authentication
system is virtually foolproof.&quot;</p>
<p>Officer Collier indicates Cindy to sit down in a chair next to
his desk. &quot;Do you want coffee, tea, maybe pop?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No thanks. . . . I just want for all this to be solved,
it's driving me nuts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can understand. OK, so this biometric authentication,
why are you using it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's a test project. We had several break-ins due
to bad passwords, and due to people not logging out when they
left their computers unattended.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, like this Russian hacker you say defaced your
Website, or your niece Samantha getting administrative privileges
by using your terminal?&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy blushes and nods. &quot;Yes, at least that's how we
think she got in, and it makes sense. So we've been looking to
get rid of passwords, and we decided on a combination of
smartcards and biometric authentication. We decided as well that
any cryptographic processing has to be done on the card.
Otherwise the key would need to be copied off the smartcard,
meaning it could easily be copied.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, why didn't you use tokens? They are completely
self-contained.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If someone steals the token and the PIN number, or
guesses it, they can get in. Plus, by requiring a special card
reader on workstations, it makes it a little harder for an
attacker to attempt a break-in via it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK, makes sense, go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So we decided to use a smartcard system that was
certificate-based. This makes logging access really easy,
especially with our Web-based systems, and they can also use it
to sign and encrypt email easily &#151; something tokens don't
do.&quot;</p>

<tr>
<td>Tokens (CRYPTOCard, RSA, etc.) are great for
authentication, and do not require a special card reader.
However, they cannot be used to sign or encrypt email,
whereas X.509-based smartcards can.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&quot;OK, so this system would handle more than just
authentication, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. We figured we might as well kill several birds with
one stone. The next problem was how to protect the certificate on
the card. While it is virtually impossible to remove if you don't
have the password, it is possible to put some sort of key logging
software on a workstation that records the password. Then the
attacker can steal the card and use it until it is revoked, which
could take several days if it's over a long weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK, So you've got smartcards with onboard cryptographic
processing, and certificate creation and storage. But wouldn't it
be possible for an attacker to load software on the workstation
that captures the user's fingerprint when they scan their finger
in to access their smartcard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, the scanner is placed on the smartcard. It's not on
the reader. This makes the smartcard completely self-contained,
and very hard to attack or compromise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you need to scan your finger to access your
smartcard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and it can tell whether it's a live or dead
finger.&quot; She pauses. &quot;So it's not like the attacker
could have cut off Jeff's finger, warmed it up and used it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm. . . . And you're sure the access came after the
alleged incident where you found Jeff dead in the server
room?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, over a day afterwards. I disabled his accounts but
forgot about his test administrative account. We haven't yet
integrated the token system with our normal procedures.&quot;</p>

&quot;passwords&quot; &#151; fingerprints, retinal
patterns, and the rest.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&quot;OK, so for the attacker to get in, they needed Jeff's
card, a reader, and the fingerprint?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. So it must have been Jeff that logged in! The
chances of someone else having the same fingerprint or close
enough are minuscule. And I talked to the manufacturer; they
claim it's not breakable yet. It's driving me nuts!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OK, let's take a look at that video footage, and the

handing them to Officer Collier.</p>

<h2>The Story of Jeff, Part XIV</h2>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;So that's the surveillance footage you managed to
recover off of Jeff's hard drive?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Apparently he had maintenance install a splitter
and run a second cable from the camera to his office.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, at least we now know that it wasn't a murder. Of
course there's still the matter of the missing body, and
Samantha.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and the intruder getting into our systems using
Jeff's fingerprint, which shouldn't be possible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, there is that. I think you should talk to Agent
Moldy at the FBI.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy nods and follows Officer Collier out of the room.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Deep in the wastelands of Arizona, we see Samantha entering a
large cave set in a hillside. Continuing down the cave with the
aid of a flashlight, she stumbles over rocks until arriving at a
large steel door. Grunting, she shoves on it, and a high-pitched
wail echoes down the cave as old metal is forced to move for the
first time in years. Squeezing through the opening, she looks
back once at the faint point of light before closing the door and
continuing on in total darkness. </p>
<p>Samantha arrives at the end of the tunnel. Examining another
metal door, she notes the undisturbed dust and spider webs with
approval before hauling it open and entering. Flicking on a light
switch, she closes the door and starts to beat the dust out of
her clothes.</p>

<p>Smiling, Agent Moldy shakes Cindy's hand. &quot;So I hear you
have a weird crime?&quot; Cindy nods and starts to tell the
complete story, occasionally pausing to wipe her eyes. She winds
down quietly and blows her nose. She looks exhausted.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I'll start by doing a background check on Jeff,
and Samantha. Let me just fire up my computer.&quot;</p>
<p>Sitting down at his desk, Agent Moldy turns on a rather
severe-looking Sun workstation. He points his Web browser at
http://www.usshadowgovernment.com/. Clicking on the National
Database, he enters Jeff's SSN and name into the appropriate
fields before hitting Search. </p>

</table>
<p>&quot;Well, that's interesting. According to this Jeff has a
twin brother &#151; did he ever mention that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no he didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I'll just pull up his information, run it against
the surveillance tape and see if they match.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhh, isn't stuff like this illegal? I mean, how do you
make sure people don't sell or steal information about other
people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good question, I'm not sure.&quot;</p>

</table>
<p>Agent Moldy turns back to his computer and watches the status
bar slowly slide towards 100%. </p>
<p>&quot;Yup, it's a match. Jeff's twin brother dragged the body
away.&quot;</p>
<p>A rather stunned Cindy pauses before speaking. &quot;But why
did he do this? Why on earth would he go to all this
trouble?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, according to Jeff's file, he's evil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Evil? What are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a well-documented fact. You know how identical
twins happen, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, the cell splits and you get two copies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right. Well, in rare cases the cell splits perfectly,
but for some reason nature abhors identical copies, so in the
case of DNA-identical twins, one is evil and one is good.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy nods. &quot;You're crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, see, right here.&quot; Turning the screen, Agent
Moldy points his finger under a text field with a single word,
&quot;EVIL.&quot; </p>
<p>Cindy's brain temporarily freezes up as this new and utterly
strange information refuses to mesh with her version of reality.
After several moments her frontal lobes submit and quietly store
the data. &quot;So you're saying Jeff was evil, and his exact
twin took the body, cleaned up, and...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it's well documented. The good twin wants to rid
the world of the evil twin, but because they are good, they
cannot kill the evil twin. So they usually start stalking the
evil twin, learning what the evil twin knows, and waiting for the
twin to die. Once the evil twin dies, they usually dispose of the
body and assume the evil twin's place, so that people are not
emotionally hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy gently rubs her temples. &quot;So what you're saying is
we hired an evil twin, who was killed in an accident, so his good
twin disposed of the body, and will be showing up at work to take
his place?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, isn't that just peachy. What am I supposed to
do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing at all, since no real crime took place, we're
not too interested. I'd advise letting the good twin take his
place, and get on with life.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy nods, not sure what to think of this all.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Several days later at a staff meeting, Cindy and the rest
pause as they hear a knock on the door. After a moment the door
opens and Jeff^2 sticks his head in. &quot;Am I interrupting
anything?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not at all, we were actually just discussing the
biometric system, and any possible weaknesses in it.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeff^2 nods. &quot;I think it's OK. The chances of someone
having an identical fingerprint are astronomically small.&quot;</p>
<p>Andy grins. &quot;I agree. So I can order 4,000 units?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>The End. Seriously. This is it. No more. Of course, I'll soon
be starting a Unix-based series. No rest for the wicked. </p>
