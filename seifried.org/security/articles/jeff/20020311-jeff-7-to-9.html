<h2>The Story of Jeff: Part VII</h2>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somewhere in a tacky but well-lit office deep in the bowels of
Acme Corp., a printer comes to life, spitting out several sheets
of paper. It shudders to a halt and silence returns. Andy picks
up the printouts and starts flipping through them. A small twitch
at the corner of his mouth slowly develops into a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Jeff, I think we've found it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh, found what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The hacker, from Russia, we've got his phone
number,&quot; replies Andy, drumming his fingers nervously on the
desk.</p>
<p>&quot;How sure are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty sure. It fits the access pattern &#151; same
time, he tried several times, login failed, the user is not in
Russia, in fact, he was working late last night in building
X.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds good to me. Let me call Cindy and we'll meet for
lunch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK Jeff.&quot; Hanging up the phone, Andy glances up at
the clock. 11:15. He decides to reread a few pages on Windows
security policies.</p>
<p>Every phone call has an equal and opposite phone call. Jeff's
reaction to Andy's call results in a call to Cindy to arrange
lunch. In turn, Cindy makes a phone call to her niece Samantha.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Sam, I'm sorry but I won't be able to make it for
lunch today like I promised.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you promised! We had this planned weeks ago!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but something came up. We can do it tomorrow,
I promise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You promised last time!&quot; Slamming the phone down,
Samantha lets out a primal scream. Then she wrenches the phone
off again and throws it into the wall with a resounding crack.</p>
<p>Shaking her head violently, Samantha heads for her desk. She
takes several deep breaths and, grinning ferally, starts to
compose an email:</p>

Please find attached some blueprints for an old Acme 
Corp. favorite, the mark 4 anvil with optional drop hooks.
This is just a taste of what is available. I can send you
blueprints to all their current stuff and their research
and development labs for a measly $1 million US.
Have a nice day.

<p>Meanwhile, in the cheerful employee cafeteria at Acme Corp.,
we see three people at a table in the corner. Cindy is waving her
fork animatedly. &quot;I think we should report him to the police
and provide them with evidence of the break-in. Prosecute
him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that such a great idea?&quot; Andy asks. &quot;The
negative publicity, we already got hacked once. We've kicked them
out and secured our network. I say we let things be and get on
with work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think you both have valid points,&quot; Jeff replies
in a calm tone. &quot;I spoke with the CEO this morning and he
said we're not going to prosecute. The chances of a conviction
are far too slim, and the publicity isn't what we want&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That spineless gimp! If we go after this guy, it'll make
any other hacker think twice about messing with us. We need to
set an example. We have an office in Europe; they can coordinate
with the police.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Cindy, we are not going to prosecute. However, the
CEO did authorize me to hire a Russian investigator to find the
identity of our hacker. After that we'll decide how to proceed,
as well&#151;&quot;</p>
<p>Andy interrupts. &quot;We should call him up and tell him we
know where he lives!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, that might even be considered a threat and be
illegal. We're definitely not going to do anything illegal. Both
of you got that? Cindy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK Jeff, but I still say we prosecute him.&quot;</p>
<p>Andy and Cindy look at their plates rather unhappily. Jeff
slowly pushes a French fry around with his spoon. &quot;Look, I
think we should nail him to the wall, too, but until the CEO
makes up his mind we have to sit on it.&quot;</p>

We are very interested, but 1 million seems a bit steep.
We will pay you $5,000 to the bank account of your choice 
for each existing product you send us the complete blueprints for
and $10,000 for each R&amp;D project.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sun rises, the sun sets. Men and women go to work and then
they go home. People go about their daily lives, oblivious to the
growing storm that is about to explode around them like a Ford
Pinto getting rear-ended in a low-speed collision. </p>
<p>High over the Atlantic zooms a large corporate jet with
&quot;EMCA&quot; painted on its fuselage. A man sits in a large
padded chair, and on his lap a large pink longhair Tibetan
mountain cat, purring softly. </p>
<p>&quot;Ms. Pinkleweather, have we got an update on our new
research effort?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Herr Doctor. The first five files were uploaded
several hours ago. As soon as our lab finishes verifying them, we
will send the money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Purrrfect. Soon we can begin production of their best
products in our secret Antarctic factory. That was a brilliant
move, if I say so myself . . . the tax breaks are amazing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Herr Doctor, and using penguins to assemble the
products was a stroke of genius, especially with the worldwide
drop in herring prices.&quot;</p>

project X-53 but it says folder not found, so I did a search for
it, but I couldn't find it.&quot;</p>

accidentally deleted or moved it. I'll restore a backup &#151;

at a workstation under a test account and smiles at the missing

what do we do about any existing network shares?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhmmm . . . we could scan the network for machines with
ports 137 and 139 open, and then see if they have any

<h2>The Story of Jeff - Part IX</h2>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Oy vey, oy vey, third session circuit court of Acme Corp
Inc. is now in session, the honorable Judge William E. Coyote
presiding. All stand.&quot;</p>
<p>A quiet shuffling as people stand and stare at the judge.</p>
<p>&quot;You may be seated. Bailiff, read the charges
please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The defendant, Cindy Plunkett, stands accused of high
treason against the company. The sentence is 40 years of forced
labor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you. The prosecutor may begin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, your honor. As we all know, the defendant is
guilty. We have incontrovertible evidence and witness testimony
to offer.&quot;</p>
<p>The prosecutor smirks at Cindy's lawyer and sits down.</p>
<p>&quot;Your honor, my client is simply a victim of
circumstance. She did not copy secret research data and send it
to an outside source via her email account, as the prosecution
claims. We will be offering an alternative theory that will
explain what happened.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The prosecution may call its first witness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We call Jeff Chang to the stand. Please state your name
and position with the company.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name is Jeff Chang. I am currently in charge of the
network.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When did you first suspect the defendant to be a
disloyal, backstabbing traitor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ehhh? I never said that! I said I think she might be
sending out research data, and next thing I know some corporate
security goons are hitting me in the head with a sack of
doorknobs, and then here I am in the courtroom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you describe to us the evidence you found?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhh, sure. Well, I noticed that Cindy's mail account was
wedged; she'd been sending out a lot of large emails. She said
she didn't send them, so I decided to check further. I found
she'd sent out five 10-megabyte files, which means she hit the
quota of 50 megs per week of email. I managed to find a copy of
the sixth email that was supposed to be sent and found it was a
single file, either compressed or encrypted. I haven't been able
to decode it yet. </p>
<p>&quot;So I was curious as to what it might be, and I
remembered several helpdesk trouble tickets regarding research
data going missing, so I decided to check the access logs on
them. They showed that Cindy's account had accessed the files.
But the access time on these files was 4 a.m., and I checked with
security and Cindy wasn't in the building then. But she could
have accessed it remotely, or written a script that waited till 4
a.m. to do it.&quot;</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Jeff glances nervously at Cindy. He
wonders if the homicidal look in her face is real or not.</p>
<p>&quot;So anywise, I checked Cindy's machine and found she had
PGP installed, along with an unknown public key. When I checked
to see if the file was PGP-encrypted, it was, so it looks like
research data was copied, encrypted and then sent out via email.
I checked Cindy's workstation some more and found a script set to
run in Windows Scheduler that did all this at 4 a.m.&quot;</p>

<td>Windows Task Scheduler is a really nifty tool and

</table>
<p>&quot;And this was all done from Cindy's workstation. There is
no sign of anyone else involved?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Er . . . no . . . I don't think so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your honor, the prosecution rests.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy leans over to her lawyer and whispers, &quot;Don't
forget to ask about the KeyGhost. I'm not doing 40 years of
forced labor in the marketing department.&quot; Cindy's lawyer
pales slightly and nods.</p>
<p>&quot;Jeff, you say you found all this evidence on Cindy's
computer, correct?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it possible that someone could have accessed Cindy's
computer remotely, or locally, and done all this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Someone like the attacker that broke in several times
from Russia?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or someone with physical access to her computer, in a
normally unlocked office?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your honor, I have here defense exhibit A, a list of all
personnel with physical access to Cindy's office. As you can see,
the list is over 100 names long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So noted. Label exhibit A and put it in the
shoebox.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you. Now Jeff, if this had been set up remotely,
or locally, would there be any way to tell?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, not really, if they did it locally . . . but they
would have had to get Cindy's password, and we've recently had
everyone reset their passwords.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed they would have. Your honor, I have here defense
exhibit B. Jeff, can you identify this item?&quot;</p>
<p>Jeff takes the piece of PS/2 cable with a big lump in the
middle and looks at it for a moment. &quot;I'm sorry, no I
can't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your honor, this is called a KeyGhost. It's a piece of
hardware you simply plug in between the keyboard and the computer
and it logs all the keystrokes. You can later retrieve these
keystrokes, meaning any passwords and so on would be easily
discovered. It was found attached to Cindy's machine, and five
other machines in the building, mostly executives. We dusted them
for fingerprints and found some. Unfortunately, they did not
match anything in the employee database, meaning they were put in
by an external intruder.&quot;</p>

<td>Getting DNA samples from all your employees may not
be possible, but getting a photograph is probably a good
idea. And if you can, you may want to collect

</table>
<p>&quot;Pending further evidence, I am dismissing the case
against Cindy Plunkett. In light of the fact that we have an
external intruder, I suggest we find out who it is as fast as
possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Oy vey, oy vey, third session circuit court of Acme Corp
Inc. is now closed, the honorable Judge William E. Coyote
presiding. All stand.&quot;</p>
<p>Is Samantha's retirement fund blown? Is the slight wobble in
the tape storage rack actually a problem? Is Jeff allergic to
cats?</p>
