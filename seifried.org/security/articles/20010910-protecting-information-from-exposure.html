<h2>Information exposure</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you ask an administrator what they have done to protect
information from being stolen or otherwise disclosed they will
often respond with filesystem ACL's, strong user authentication
and so forth. Unfortunately the strongest ACL's and user
authentication in the world will only protect you from certain
limited types of threats. It doesn't matter how strong your NT
filesystem permissions are if I steal your laptop and use
something like a dos boot disk with NTFS support to simply read
all the files, or reset your password with NTLocksmith.
Additionally information has an annoying tendency of ending up in
odd places that you may not have expected, for example users may
save data to a floppy disk or email it to themselves at home so
they can work on it from there. Fortunately there are solutions
to these problems, however without user education and support
from management most will not be effective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Limiting access</h3>
<p>The first step is to limit access to the services and systems
that share out or contain sensitive information. Firewalling file
sharing protocols such as SMB, NFS and AFS at your border
gateways is a good idea, indeed, any sharing of data over other
networks should probably be done via virtual private networking
or other forms of encryption. Of course these types of controls
have absolutely no effect on &quot;insiders&quot;, any user with
files on a file server will of course mean that they can
potentially get at other user's files. This is typically where
the next major defense line is, filesystem access control lists.
In the Unix world we typically have three sets of permissions on
a file, user, group and other as a bare minimum. In the NT/2000
and more advanced Unix world file permissions can typically be
assigned arbitrarily to an almost infinite degree of complexity.
If these file and directory permissions are setup correctly then
a user should only have access to the files that they need access
to and nothing more. Unfortunately this is often not the case as
administrators and users will often assign overly permissive file
permissions due to a number of reasons, the main one being if you
don't have access to a file you are much more likely to notice
that then if you accidentally have access to a file you
shouldn't. There are a number of solutions on the market that
address these problems, however they are typically add-on
packages and do not come with the operating system. These file
permissions of course rely on being able to accurately identify
the user, which means that strong user authentication must be
used otherwise the system of ACL's is largely useless. The vast
majority of enterprises still rely on usernames and passwords
which are far from ideal. Users often have the same password for
multiple systems (at work and home) meaning that the exposure of
a password for an unrelated service is probably sufficient to
gain access to some other more secure service. User's accessing
POP mail boxes of FTP accounts at their ISP would transmit their
password in the clear, a smart attacker would try this password
against the corporate servers. To make matters worse some forms
of file sharing, such as NFS, do not even rely on user
authentication, instead directories are shared out with their
file permissions and the remote end is trusted to report the user
as being the correct one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protecting network traffic</h3>
<p>To add insult to injury most file sharing protocols either do
not support strong encryption or do not use it by default, so no
matter how strong your filesystem ACL's are if a user must access
data over the network chances are an attacker can view and copy
it (or possibly even alter in). The best way to solve these
problems is to use string encryption everywhere, thus an attacker
will not be able to grab passwords from the network, or view
information as it passes along. Network level encryption in the
form of IPSec is growing in popularity and ease of deployment,
network cards from Intel with crypto acceleration hardware built
in are only $50 now and will allow a workstation or server to
encrypt all network traffic with only a minimal loss in
performance. Novell supports strong encryption of network traffic
using it's own proprietary methods however all the Novell clients
(i.e. Win32) support it making it easy to deploy. Windows file
sharing (SMB/CIFS) supports the use of SSL, however a smart
attacker will be able to execute a man in the middle attack using
a variety of SSL tools. NFS does not support encryption however
TCFS does and can be used as a replacement for NFS with most
platforms if network encryption of the data traffic is needed
[1]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Information leakage</h3>
<p>So once you've secured the areas that you know sensitive data
resides or will travel through it is time to start looking at the
areas where that data may end up unintentionally (or otherwise).
When you edit a file on a computer for example that file not only
exists on the harddrive in it's protected location, but is also
loaded into memory so it can be manipulated. This often results
in the data being written to a swap file or partition without the
users knowledge or consent, an attacker will be able to retrieve
data from these locations with little difficulty if access is
gained. OpenBSD for example now supports an encrypted swap
partition, in the file /etc/sysctl.conf simply enable
vm.swapencrypt.enable:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>vm.swapencrypt.enable=1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In windows NT and 2000 you can force the swap file(s) to be
held on certain partitions, creating a small (i.e. 200 megs for a
100 meg swap file) D: drive and placing the swap file there not
only reduces the risk of it getting fragmented but makes it much
easier to control access to it since controlling access to the C:
drive on a windows machine tightly will often break many
applications. In Linux you can encrypt partitions using a number
of methods and could in theory mount a swap file (instead of a
swap partition) on an encrypted partition to protect it however
this is rather cumbersome. With the apparent death of the
International Kernel crypto patch and several other software
packages that allowed for the encryption of the entire system the
future of encrypted swap files does not look good for Linux. </p>
<p>As well there are any number of directories a user can copy a
file to in most systems, for example on Unix the /tmp directory
is often world readable and writeable, it is easy for an attacker
to monitor this directory and &quot;steal&quot; files as they are
copied in. One way to help prevent this is to set a strong umask
for users, i.e. the default file permissions used when a file is
created, &quot;man &lt;shellname&gt;&quot; will contain the
necessary information, unfortunately many Unix systems still
default to having world writeable umasks. </p>
<p>Restricting access to removable devices is required if you do
not want users to be able to take information home with them, in
Unix simply assigning the appropriate permissions to the /dev/*
entries will do the trick. For Windows a commercial software
packages such as SecureNT can be used to limit access to
removable media [2]. If users have access to the Internet then it
is possible that they can upload files, restricting access for
outgoing protocols such as SSH, FTP, RSYNC, TFTP as well as the
users ability to install additional file transfer software on
their workstation can prevent them from sending out information.
Of course almost every user now has access to email, meaning they
can simply attach the files and hit send, to prevent this you can
often block outgoing attachments in most mail server packages or
buy add on software to prevent this type of activity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>There are any number of ways in which information can be
exposed to an attacker, either through direct attacks or passive
attacks. If you are worried about inside users accessing and
sending out sensitive information then your problem is that much
harder, as they often have legitimate access to the data you are
trying to protect. Hopefully some of the ideas and solutions
present this week will help you, as well next week is part two
which will go into destruction of data and some other interesting
areas. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>File encryption</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned before one method to help prevent information
from being exposed is to encrypt it. Unfortunately encrypting
data effectively is a lot harder then it should be, consequently
it is often not done correctly, if at all due to the challenges.
There are a large number of commercial products and other
software packages that enable you to encrypt data on your
harddrive, I will cover them by each major OS in a sort of
practical guide format along with the pitfalls that may be
present. No solution fits all, so it is very difficult for me to
actually give any a strong recommendation over each other (they
all work reasonably well). The beauty of encryption is that in
theory if it is done correctly an attacker has absolutely no way
to get at the data unless they somehow steal the encryption keys.
If you use a strong passphrase to protect your keys or store your
keys offline then even with physical possession of the device
(i.e. a laptop) an attacker would still have to try a huge number
of combination, and in theory should not be able to break it
using brute force. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Key and data recovery</h3>
<p>Probably one of the thorniest issues with encryption is the
subject of key recovery and escrow. People encrypt data so that
other people cannot get at it. Unfortunately this means that just
like the attacker if you have a legitimate need to the data but
the person that knows the key's passphrase is not available you
are out of luck. And unlike locking your keys in the car you
cannot generally call upon someone to quickly decrypt the data
(if someone else could quickly decrypt the data that would negate
the whole point of encrypting it in the first place). However for
many corporations there is a legitimate need for key escrow or
key recovery, what happens in Johnson gets crushed to death by a
stack of old 386's? What happens if Johnson quits on bad terms
with the company and refuses to give the key up (while there may
be legal recourse that doesn't guarantee that you will get your
data). The problem with key escrow is that it is very &quot;in
the face&quot; of users, i.e. when they create a key set your
demand a copy, or worse yet issue them the keys. As well you must
make sure that you store these copies of the keys very securely,
otherwise someone that wants to get at the encrypted data may
have an easy way to get it. Key recovery varies in exact
implementation but a good implementation will be configurable so
that it can reflect company policies. For example a small firm
may grant their sysadmin who they trust the ability to recover
keys, this means that the sysadmin can get at any data encrypted
with recoverable keys, probably without anyone else finding out.
A larger firm such as a bank may require 5 officers to each
participate in the key recovery process (by using a split
password or split keys, etc.) so that no individuals or small
groups can get at corporate data without others knowing. If the
product does not support key recovery then you will need to use
key escrow. Make sure that anytime a user creates a new key they
register it, otherwise if Johnson creates a new key and starts
using it when the 386 crushes his brain pan the data will be lost
forever. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PGP for Windows</h3>
<p>Probably the best all-round encryption program available
currently. Sadly the source code is no longer available for
auditing, which is why Phillip Zimmerman (the creator of PGP)
apparently left NAI for Hushmail. PGP is primarily aimed at the
Windows platform, and it contains a standard file encryption
program and key management tools as the core, on to this are
added filesystem encryption, network encryption (IPSec), a
firewall and IDS system (for network security) and plug-ins for
popular mail clients. PGP is probably the easiest third party
program to use for windows file, volume and email encryption. PGP
supports split keys (i.e. multiple people are needed to access
the secret key) and key recovery, to quote from the help file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you ever lose your private key or you forget your
passphrase, there is no way to recover from it unless your
administrator has set up a key reconstruction policy, which
includes setting up a key reconstruction server and enabling
this option in your PGP software. If this feature is enabled
in your software, you would have provided recovery
information&#151;five secret questions and answers&#151;and
would have sent your key to the key reconstruction server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you are willing to purchase the commercial PGP
encryption products and put a bit of work into it you can have a
very flexible and robust encryption infrastructure. Unfortunately
like all windows add on encryption product when it comes to
encrypting files you cannot easily encrypt files and directories,
while you can encrypt files you must decrypt them to work with
them, meaning that unencrypted copies will be floating around
your harddrive. Alternatively you can create a pseudo filesystem
(basically a file you mount like a network share), however you
must create it a certain size so you may end up wasting space or
eventually running out, as well it requires to keep all your
encrypted work on the &quot;F:&quot; drive for example [3][4]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Windows 2000 EFS</h3>
<p>EFS is built into Windows 2000 and allows you to encrypt files
and directories in a relatively easy interface (windows/file
explorer). The advantage of this over PGP or BestCrypt is that
you can encrypt an existing file or directory (however this is
not advised, see the URL at the end on EFS best practices). You
can also create a new encrypted directory (such as C:\secret) and
then any files created within this directory will be
automatically encrypted. EFS also supports key recovery, in fact
you must configure some sort of key recovery configuration before
you can use EFS, and unfortunately the administrator account
typically is the one with this access set up. If you do not want
one person to be able to access all information you must
configure the key recovery when you start installing your windows
2000 infrastructure, unfortunately for many companies they have
not done this, and probably will not (so if you are currently
using EFS you could check!). EFS has a number of security issues
and because of it's apparent ease of use most people will not be
aware of them and may inadvertently expose information, Microsoft
has issued one fix so far, but you should also educate your users
[5]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>BestCrypt for Windows and Linux</h3>
<p>BestCrypt is an add on product like PGP, however it is
available for both Windows and Linux. In addition to this the
source code is available so you can audit the code if you want to
do so. The file it uses to store the data (called the
&quot;container&quot;) can be mounted by the Linux version and
the windows version adding to it's convenience, if you dual boot
your laptop for example you can store the container on your
windows partition and access it from Windows and Linux. As far as
I know BestCrypt does not support key recovery, so if you need
access to the data you will need to enforce key escrow (or in
this case &quot;passphrase&quot; escrow) which is not as reliable
(the user may change the passphrase or create a new encrypted
container with a different key) [6]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other Linux solutions</h3>
<p>Like most operating systems Linux does not contain any
products like EFS so any encryption is either done on a per file
basis (resulting in unencrypted copies lying around) or at the
partition level. One of the most popular solutions for this was
the &quot;International Kernel patch&quot; which included strong
encryption and an interface to mount encrypted files as
partitions, however the maintainer has not released a new version
in several months and repeated attempts to contact him have
failed so I can only conclude he is dead or on a real vacation.
Other popular solutions such as PPDD which could actually enable
you to encrypt the entire filesystem (i.e. /, the swap,
everything) were not ported to the 2.4 series kernel and are
consequently not available. Hopefully other maintainers will take
up the &quot;International Kernel patch&quot;. TCFS unfortunately
has not been worked on in a while and only supports older
versions of operating systems (i.e. Linux 2.0, OpenBSD 2.7,
NetBSD 1.4.2), so your mileage may vary (i.e. if it works and
does not destroy data, great). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Unfortunately for Unix users it appears that the availability
of good filesystem encryption is on the decline, and the chances
of a major Unix (such as Linux) gaining EFS style file and
directory encryption are unlikely (it is extremely difficult to
do). The good news is that for Windows users (and let's face it,
that is the majority of most desktops) there are several
excellent solutions that cover almost every conceivable
situation, requirement and price range. Next week I will cover
destruction of data, because eventually old machines must depart
us and that gives attackers an excellent chance to have some
quality time with your data. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="#000000">Securely deleting data</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you've done everything you can to prevent information from
being exposed while it's in use. Your network is encrypted, you
use encrypted drive partitions and encrypted swap file where
possible, and blocked access to the Internet and removable
devices. No matter how hard you try chances are the data exists
somewhere in an unencrypted format that you are not aware of, a
temp file, a swap file, or from the original file server itself.
If a file was every copied to a computer with a writeable
harddrive there is a chance that it was stored on the harddrive
somewhere (either in the form of a temp file or swap space) and
subsequently deleted (but not forgotten). With modern harddrives
easily in the 40-80 gigabyte range the possibility of a file not
being overwritten is quite high, even over a lifespan of several
years. HP currently makes a line of print servers based on Linux
that comes with a 6 gigabyte harddrive. I know if I were an
industrial spy I would purchase these used if at all possible or
steal them if not possible (eventually anything of interest gets
printed out). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Who wants your data?</h3>
<p>This is a major component of any security system, what is the
level of threat against it. How much is the information worth?
Medical and banking records tend to have a long lifespan
(sometimes longer then the life of the individual they concern)
and are typically of great interest to certain people (opponents
of politicians, journalists, etc.). If the information is a
selection of R&amp;D projects with proprietary methods (i.e. the
11 secret spices that KFC uses) then the information would of
course be of great interest to certain parties. The largest
components for calculating the &quot;value&quot; would be the
actual value of the data, and the length of time for which it is
useful. If data will still be of interest in 100 years then it is
probably advisable to take extreme measure to prevent it from
disclosure. Of course the technical ability of your adversary is
a major component, and if the data will be valuable for a
significant amount of time it is possible that some new currently
un-thought of technique will become available in the future. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Wiping data</h3>
<p>As the computer industry grew so did hard drives, and the
importance people placed on them for storing data. Companies
began producing software and developed hardware techniques to
retrieve data that was inadvertently deleted, formatted, hit by a
power surge and so on[10]. This has led to an arms race of sorts,
as commercial software become available to recover lost files
other manufacturers have created software to make sure that files
you want to delete stay deleted. Of course people started using
this software and accidental deletions using it occurred so
software was created to deal with the early file deletion
programs, and this in turn led to better file deletion programs.
The current state of file deletion is that most common programs
will delete a file and you will not be able to recover this file
using commercially available software. There are current methods
to physically retrieve data that has been accidentally deleted or
damaged, the success of these physical methods against current
software is, in theory, entirely possible. There are even a
number of papers online that discuss the possibilities and
methods for retrieving data from volatile memory (i.e. ram) which
was previously thought to be utterly impossible. If the timeframe
on the value of your data exceeds five years I would probably
advise against trusting in software to wipe it, and if your data
will still be valuable for ten years or more I would strongly
recommend a secure physical destruction method (more on this
later). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Software to wipe data</h3>
<p>There are four main ways of wiping data that you will probably
be interested. The first and most simple is wiping individual
file(s) and directories, this is your first line of defense,
tossing something into the recycle bin or trash can and hitting
empty is not enough. The next stage would be to regularly wipe
the free space on your system, thus anything that was deleted
(securely or not) is, well, wiped out (pun intended =). Of course
wiping free space will probably not delete something on a swap
partition or currently in a swap file (as well depending on
exactly how the swap file is configured data may linger long
times). The next step is to wipe partitions, of course wiping
your drives means you will need to reload the OS and data from
backups. This however provides a higher degree of assurance,
especially for Windows systems, because the swap file will be
completely cleaned. The last step is the most severe, you wipe
the device itself, this should destroy all the data, all the data
structures, partition tables, the master boot record and so
forth. This guarantees that data in swap partitions or on other
unused partitions is completely wiped. If you do not wipe the
device completely there will always be an element of doubt
(however slight) that some data may have remained. To wipe a
drive you can either boot from a floppy disk, put the drive into
another system or even purchase a hardware unit with that can
wipe the drive (many hardware disk copying products have this
option). </p>
<p>The problem with software wiping solutions is that in theory
if an attacker gets ahold of the drive (after it has been wiped)
there may be some flaw in the software (how many people verify
the data has been wiped using a different software package?) that
allows an attacker to retrieve data. Alternatively some stunning
new discovery might result in an attacker being able to somehow
reconstruct the orientation of bits that were physically present
at one point. As well there is much more room for error, if you
wipe a file there is no easy way to tell if the file was wiped or
not short of doing a full forensics work up on the drive. If you
do a partition or complete disk wipe then you better make sure
that the process is not interrupted (and heaven only know how
long it will take for several wipes on an 80 gig device). If your
data is truly sensitive then the next paragraph is for you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hardware to wipe data</h3>
<p>Physical destruction of the device is generally speaking a lot
more effective then a software wipe, however it is a lot more
trouble. The Pentagon reversed an order they had in place for 6
months that required the physical destruction of harddrives for
systems that had contained &quot;unclassified&quot; data, so like
many the trade off of physical destruction is not worth it for
all systems [7][8][9]. If you choose to go with a physical
destruction device make sure it meets the various DOD (Department
of Defense) standards that are applicable, if a device does not
meet DOD standards but claims to destroy data effectively be wary
of it (I would not purchase it). The most common method for
physically destroying hard drives is through the use of strong
magnetic fields that fluctuate, thus &quot;resetting&quot; all
the bits so that no data can be retrieved. Another common method
is to grind the surface of the disk off, this is more common with
CD destruction machines, but is highly effective and also has the
benefit of leaving visible proof that the unit in question has
been dealt with. The last method tends not to be used because it
is messy but consists of using heat or flame to oxidize the
surface of the platter or melt it, again leaving visible proof
that the unit in question has been dealt with. Some places will
simply drill a hole in the drive with a power drill, in theory
there is no realistic way to retrieve data from such a damaged
unit however as new technology becomes available it is likely
that retrieve the data will be possible. This also applies to
physically warping the platters (i.e. bending them in half), as
attractive as it seems you would be better off using a DOD
approved method. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Preventing people from getting at your data is never easy, but
it can be done. Care and attention must be paid to details
however with the correct procedures put in place you generally do
not need to worry about accidentally giving away a computer with
someone's medical records contained on it. In some cases it may
not be wise to give away the harddrive no matter what software
techniques you use to wipe it, taking the drive out and using a
physical destruction method is a lot safer and new harddrives are
relatively cheap. As well you may consider a yearly wipe of
systems and reloading of software to avoid data being exposed, I
would highly recommend using a free space wiper on any corporate
laptops. In short it's not easy, but it can (and probably should)
be done. </p>
