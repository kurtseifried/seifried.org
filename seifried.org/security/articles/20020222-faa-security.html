<p>The airline industry in North America is a critical component
of our economic prosperity, and even more than that a vital
component to our lifestyle. Have to be in San Diego tomorrow to
meet with a client regarding critical issues? Be there in less
than 12 hours from virtually anywhere in North America,
affordably. The airline industry in the US employs slightly over
one million people, and services like air cargo allow many other
businesses to function that depend on quick delivery of
everything from electronic components to stuffed toys and legal
documents. Yet we are coming to understand that security threats
can put a quick end to services we depend on and take for
granted.</p>
<p>After the tragic events of September 11th the FAA and
NavCanada (Canadian equivalent of the FAA) shut down all North
American airspace for several days. Unless it was a critical
government or military flight it wasn't leaving the tarmac.
Everything from FedEx and crop dusters to air ambulance services
were grounded. The airline industries in both countries are
reeling from this event, with several companies firing hundreds
to thousands of employees, and requesting their respective
federal governments for bailout packages to avoid declaring
bankruptcy. </p>
<p>In security we do not have unlimited amounts of money to
spend. We need to look at factors such as risk, threat,
vulnerabilities, cost involved in recovery, and long term effects
(such as customer confidence). It is obvious that the economic
and more importantly the human costs of September 11th vastly
outweigh anything that could have possibly been spent on air
travel security. </p>
<p>With consumer confidence in air travel severely rattled in
North America it is more critical than ever for effective
security precautions. Already, physical security concerns have
resulted in the presence of heavily armed police in airports and
armed federal air marshals on some US flights, and the following,
from the FAA website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>&quot;</i><b><i>Can I carry my pocket knife on board?</i></b><i>
No knives or cutting instruments of any size or material will
be allowed in the aircraft cabin. Knives may be transported
only in checked baggage. Airlines will no longer provide
steak knives for on-board food service.</i><sup><i>1</i></sup><i>&quot;
</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Network Security - A Critical Element</h2>
<p>But what about protecting air traffic control computer systems
and other electronic infrastructure components, which allow the
airline industry to run at high capacity with a large margin of
safety? Unfortunately on this front it seems the FAA has not done
so well. </p>
<p>The FAA is currently in the midst of a major security
overhaul, and while this has been under progress since 1998 there
are still many problems with the FAA's computer security.</p>
<p>Kenneth Mead, inspector general at the U.S. Department of
Transportation, testified at a House Science Committee hearing,
regarding the security overhaul. &quot;Under that $1 billion-plus
project,&quot; Mead said, &quot;the systems that manage air
traffic control are due to be linked to administrative systems at
the FAA, potentially opening them up to wider access. Until the
FAA gives assurances that this integrated network won't
compromise data security, we don't think the FAA should go
forward with that plan.<sup>2</sup>&quot; Unfortunately, like
many government organizations, the FAA is now paying the price of
years of IT deployment without proper security foresight.
Numerous issues plague the FAA, from interconnected networks that
are not fully documented or understood, to allowing intruders
potential avenues of access into critical systems. </p>
<p>&quot;Air traffic control computer systems within the Federal
Aviation Administration remain at risk of intrusion and malicious
attacks, despite a review last year pointing out the problems,
said Gerald Dillingham, director of physical infrastructure
issues at the General Accounting Office. Although the FAA is
making some progress in addressing 22 computer security
recommendations, most have yet to be completed, he said.<sup>3</sup>&quot;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Long Term Planning: Keeping Pace with Cyber-Terrorists</h2>
<p>The events of September 11th show that certain terrorist
groups are willing to plan long term and go to great lengths to
accomplish their goals. Even with increased physical security it
will not be impossible to re-enact terrorist attacks on the scale
of those we recently experienced. </p>
<p>Like most security problems inside threats are some of the
most potentially damaging. While it is possible to do background
checks and so forth on people, these checks are often not done
correctly, if at all. There are even reports of people with
criminal records being hired after background checks for airport
security positions. Insiders know where the vital components are,
and typically know how to do the most damage. Instead of simply
wiping a system they may be able to subvert the program or data
fed into it, resulting in similar levels of damage but with a
much higher cost in time and money to solve them (assuming the
problem is even identified correctly). </p>
<p>Even with the FAA's plans to implement strong access controls
and user authentication it will be difficult to stop people who
have been granted access to systems - and access permissions are
almost always too broad and usually outdated as well. </p>
<p>Another of the most common failings of access control systems
is reporting of failed access attempts, and more importantly of
determining why there was a failed access. Was it simply a
mistake, someone trying to access the wrong server or resource?
Or was there a more sinister intent, perhaps someone trying to
gain access to a critical internal system so they could hijack
it? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Safeguarding the Keys to the Castle in the Sky</h2>
<p>A thorough analysis of flight security must take both physical
and computer security equally seriously, as access to computer
systems today means access to the flight paths themselves. While
we hope that the events of September 11th never occur again, two
US generals have been granted authority authorize the shooting
down of hijacked aircraft on suicide missions. Of course this
depends on air traffic control being able to identify a hijacked
plane, and being able to get a location of the plane to the
military. </p>
<p>Since civilian &quot;radar&quot; primarily depends on the
craft's transponder (which can be turned off) and is not isolated
from networks, it is typically not as robust as military systems.
In the future, pulling off this type of attack will partially
depend upon being able to hijack the air traffic control system,
or being able to disable it so as to cause sufficient confusion
so that the attack is successful. </p>
<p>Although it seems unlikely that terrorists will seize control
of FAA computers and crash planes by rerouting them, certainly
access to these systems is as critical as physical access to the
planes themselves.</p>
