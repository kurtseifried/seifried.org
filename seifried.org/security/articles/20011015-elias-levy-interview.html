<p>Bugtraq is probably the best security mailing list around.
However while the quasi-founder (technically Aleph1 didn't start
Bugtraq as I was surprised to find out) is quite prominent online
I wasn't able to find any detailed information about him or
Bugtraq (except for one old interview). So here for you to enjoy
is an interview with Aleph1. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kurt: </strong>Where does the name Aleph1 come from?</p>
<p><strong>Elias:</strong> Its comes from transfinite
mathematics. There exists many &quot;infinite&quot; numbers or
sets. The first infinite number is small omega or alef null. It
is also called countable infinity. Many infinite sets can be
mapped one-to-one with each other. For example, the set of all
natural numbers can be mapped one-to-one with the set of odd
natural numbers. Yet one is a subset of the other. Both these
sets are said to have a cardinality of alef null. Alef One is the
first cardinal number after alef null (i.e. the first set that
cannot be mapped one-to-one to a set of cardinality alef null).</p>
<p>Alef one is a funny number. One of the reasons its difficult
to grasp is because it is a regular number. A number 'n' is
regular if it cannot be represented by the sum of less than 'n'
ordinals less than 'n'. Of all the ordinals between 0 and alef
one only 0, 1, 2 and alef null are regular. You can't write 0 as
the sum of less than 0 terms less than 0 (doesn't make sense).
Nor can you write 1 as the sum of less than 1 terms less than 1.
Nor can you write 2 as the sum of less than 2 terms less than 2.
If you live in an universe were all you known is the number 1 how
can you grasp the number 2? Alef One is also regular. Its
difficult to reach alef one from bellow. </p>
<p>As I mentioned alef null is the cardinality of the natural
numbers. The question of whether the cardinality of the real
numbers is alef one is called the Continuum Hypothesis (since the
real numbers are used to represent a continuum). Interestingly is
has been proven that whatever the cardinality of the real numbers
is its also the same cardinality as the set of points in a
continuous line, continuous plane, and continuous volume. The
Continuum Hypothesis was the first problem in Hilbert's list of
23 important unsolved problems in mathematics. It has been proven
that the Continuum Hypothesis and its negation are both
consistent with standard set theory and logic, and are thus
independent of it. Yet the Continuum Hypothesis has not been
adopted as an axiom of set theory.</p>
<p>I picked up that handle many years ago while reading the book
&quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot; by Rudy Rucker. I also
recommend the book &quot;The Mystery of the Aleph&quot; by Amir
D. Aczel and &quot;White Light&quot; by Rudy Rucker. The latter
is a science fiction book written by Rucker that deals with
infinity. Rucker is a very interesting man himself. He is a
professor of mathematics at San Jose university and author of
such science fiction mind bending books like Software, Freeware,
Wetware and The Hacker and the Ants. </p>
<p><strong>Kurt:</strong> What prompted you to start Bugtraq?
When you started Bugtraq what the public reaction, if any?</p>
<p><strong>Elias: </strong>Bugtraq was started by Scott Chasin,
not me. Scott started the list as a reaction to a lack of useful
information about security vulnerabilities. At the time CERT was
almost useless (read some of the earlier advisories and try to
figure out what the problem is) and vendors did little to help.
Systems were ridiculously easy to break into. System
administrator started to depend on each other to stay informed.
The firewall mailing list was used some times to discuss
vulnerabilities but it was outside it charter and the list owned
did not want exploits or detailed information on his list. This
environment prompted Scott to start BUGTRAQ in 1993.</p>
<p>At first BUGTRAQ was no more that a few hundred users. I took
over the list in 1996 after Scott decided he was no longer
interested in managing it. Since then the last has grown up to a
peak of over forty thousand subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt:</strong> Long term, do you see Bugtraq
continuing in the same vein as it does now? Do you have any long
term goals for Bugtraq?</p>
<p><strong>Elias:</strong> As BUGTRAQ and the Internet have grown
so have the number of topics and messages send to the list. This
means that many people receive information that are interested
in. Subscribing to BUGTRAQ can sometimes seem like sucking water
from a fire hose. My main goal for BUGTRAQ at the moment is to
figure out a way to either implement filtering by topic server
side or facility such filtering on the client side. We are
investigating possible ways to implement this feature
(suggestions are welcomed). I hope that this will make BUGTRAQ
more manageable for the subscribers and more accessible to the
many people that wish to subscribe but don't because of the
message volume.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt: </strong>For system security, do you think the
future is in auditing and producing secure code, such as OpenBSD,
or in things like MAC and type enforcement, such as the NSA's
SELinux or Argus Pitbull for Solaris?</p>
<p><strong>Elias: </strong>Actually, I see the future being
almost as bleak as it is today. Auditing efforts like the one
from the OpenBSD project are a must. They are a baseline. Systems
that have not gone through a source code security audit should
include a mandatory tag that says &quot;Lasciate ogne speranza,
voi ch'intrate&quot; (Abandon hope all ye who enter here).</p>
<p>But even so I find UNIX's security model as being to
simplistic. The all or nothing approach does not lend itself well
to the principle of least privilege or to defense in depth. In
such simple model running an insecure application in a well
audited operating system will defeat the benefits of the audit.
The folks from OpenBSD and similar projects can only audit some
many lines of code in a given amount of time. The trusted
computing base will never offer all the feature users want. </p>
<p>On the other hand I find most of the implementations (and many
times the ideas) of mandatory access controls, type enforcement,
privileges, etc as being to complex. They provide more
flexibility and fine grained control but at the expense of ease
of use. A complex system is seldom implemented or configured
correctly resulting in vulnerabilities. I find this is
exacerbated when you try to bolt these security models to an
existing one (as is the case with many of the implementations now
available for Linux). They result in difficult to predict
interactions that many result on vulnerabilities (recall the
sendmail vulnerability that was the result of privileges being
introduced into the Linux kernel). </p>
<p>In a perfect world we would be able to find a middle model
that provided ease of use, transparency and flexibility without
being simplistic or overly complex. The model would be
implemented as part of a new operating system so that there would
be no conflicts with some previous model, and which would allow
applications to make full use of the model's capabilities.</p>
<p>Of curse this is a pipe dream as an operating system is only
as useful as the applications available for it, and the resources
required to write all the applications users expect to be
available is astronomical.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt: </strong>Do you think the majority of commercial
vendors currently take security seriously, or are they simply
paying lip service to it? Do you think the will improve, stay the
same, or get worse in the future (as features and connectivity
increases)?</p>
<p><strong>Elias:</strong> I don't think this is a meaningful
question. Corporations only purpose is to generate money.
Software vendors attempt to make money by selling software. They
write software based on what they believe are their customers
priorities. If they match those priorities well they will succeed
and make money. If they don't they will fail and loose money.
Software vendors will only &quot;take security seriously&quot;
when their customers do. Until then they have no incentive to
write secure software. </p>
<p>This is an oversimplification but its the basic truth. Things
are somewhat complicated by the fact that some operating system
vendors have monopolies and can sometimes ignore the priority of
their customers. Also corporations not only want to make money,
they also don't want to loose any. So the fact that software
vendors are not liable for writing insecure software means they
have one less reason to write secure software. And the fact that
the are third-party products that help alleviate the security
concerns (albeit not very successfully) gives software companies
one less reason to write secure software (let the people that
want security buy an add-on package). </p>
<p>But in the end its the publics fault.</p>
<p>Things will continue as they are until vendors become liable
for security problems in their products (an unlikely event given
the lobbying done by the industry unless the fear mongers are
correct and we have an &quot;electronic Perl Harbor&quot; and the
government steps in), or until insurance companies start offering
computer security insurance and charge astronomic rates unless
you are using products from vendors that make security a priority
(this is a more likely event). </p>
<p><strong>Kurt: </strong>As computers become increasingly
connected (high speed ADSL, cablemodems, etc.) and software like
ShareSniffer becomes increasingly prevalent do you think things
will get much worse, or will users become more savvy and protect
themselves?</p>
<p><strong>Elias: </strong>Things will be worse for the
foreseeable future. For each person that learns a lesson in the
school of hard knocks two new people join the Internet. This
pattern will go on for a while. The number of likely victims will
continue to grow. Maybe many years from now when everyone that
lives is born after the Internet and is familiar with it people
will be computer security savvy by nature. But that is a long
ways off. Today you need no &quot;drivers license&quot; to join
the Internet. You are given no advice before you are thrown into
the deep end of the pool. Heck, most people only known enough
about their computers to dial-up to the ISP, read their mail and
browser the web. How can we expect these people to securely
manage a general purpose computer?</p>
<p><strong>Kurt:</strong> If you had one wish to improve computer
security, ignoring backwards compatibility as so on, what would
it be?</p>
<p><strong>Elias: </strong>Mandatory computer security class for
CS majors. rm -Rf * all software (and some hardware) and start
from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking I agree with Aleph1's views, especially the
fact that users have not been demanding security as an important
factor in products. While it is unlikely that we will be able to
start from scratch completely there are some efforts such as
OpenBSD, NSA SELinux and Eros to build a better foundation. </p>
