<p><a href="20020414-ssh-name.html">What's in a name?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2"><b>February 14, 2001 - </b>Yesterday it
became public knowledge that Tatu Ylonen, the creator of the
SSH protocol and founder of a company with the same name,
asked the OpenSSH group to change its name. Normally such a
case, a commercial company asking someone to change its name,
wouldn't be a terribly big deal &#151; but in this case it
is. SSH was first used as the name for a protocol,
&quot;Secure SHell.&quot; The SSH protocol uses strong crypto
and public key cryptography and provides a secure replacement
for insecure protocols such as Telnet, rexec, rcp, rsh, FTP
and so on. In addition, the SSH protocol features tunneling,
allowing you to easily wrap insecure protocols such as POP or
X and face far fewer worries when using them. </font></p>

Detection Systems and Virus Scanners - Are They The Answer?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">It takes a lot less effort to destroy and
break things, than it takes to build and fix them. This is
nowhere more evident then computer networks. Corporations,
governments, universities and other organizations spend large
sums of money on computer network infrastructure, and the
cost of keeping them running is not trivial. And this doesn't
even take into consideration malicious attacks and security
controls which add even more cost to building and maintaining
a network of computers. </font></p>

<p><a href="jeff/">The Story of Jeff</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">This story is the ongoing saga of Jeff, a
tragic tale full of hardship, heartbreak and triumph over
impossible odds. Jeff is your average network administrator,
responsible for Acme, Inc.'s Microsoft-based corporate
network. We start with the basics, but as Jeff's network is
broken into again and again, we spiral steadily into madness
and insanity.</font></p>

<p><a href="20020222-faa-security.html">Airline Computer Security
- Key to Thwarting Terror</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">The airline industry in North America is a
critical component of our economic prosperity, and even more
than that a vital component to our lifestyle. Have to be in
San Diego tomorrow to meet with a client regarding critical
issues? Be there in less than 12 hours from virtually
anywhere in North America, affordably. The airline industry
in the US employs slightly over one million people, and
services like air cargo allow many other businesses to
function that depend on quick delivery of everything from
electronic components to stuffed toys and legal documents.
Yet we are coming to understand that security threats can put
a quick end to services we depend on and take for granted.</font></p>

<p><a href="20020126-keyboard-sniffing.html">Keyboard sniffing</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Keyboard is a useful techniques for
computer investigators, forensics specialists and people who
are overly curious in their surroundings. Many modern
security practices, such as encryption, are virtually
impossible to brute force, and if the defender is using a
good passphrase then it is virtually impossible to hit the
right combination unless you are very lucky. The answer to
this, and other password protected services is of course to
use a keyboard sniffer, in effect tricking the subject into
revealing their password. </font></p>

<p><a href="20011023-devil-in-details.html">Devil in the details
- why package signing matters</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">This articles discusses the Red Hat
response to KSSA-002. To quote Red Hat: &quot;Preston Brown,
director of Linux engineering for Red Hat, said the software
firm doesn't digitally sign the two packages because the firm
doesn't consider it necessary.&quot; This articles discusses
why it is neccesary. Updated October 24 - Red Hat has signed
the packages and stated they will sign all packages in
future. A happy ending. </font></p>

<p><a href="20011015-elias-levy-interview.html">Interview with
Elias Levy (Bugtraq)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Bugtraq is probably the best security
mailing list around. However while the quasi-founder
(technically Aleph1 didn't start Bugtraq as I was surprised
to find out) is quite prominent online I wasn't able to find
any detailed information about him or Bugtraq (except for one
old interview). So here for you to enjoy is an interview with
Aleph1. </font></p>

<p><a href="20010910-protecting-information-from-exposure.html">Protecting
information from exposure</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">If you ask an administrator what they have
done to protect information from being stolen or otherwise
disclosed they will often respond with filesystem ACL's,
strong user authentication and so forth. Unfortunately the
strongest ACL's and user authentication in the world will
only protect you from certain limited types of threats. It
doesn't matter how strong your NT filesystem permissions are
if I steal your laptop and use something like a dos boot disk
with NTFS support to simply read all the files, or reset your
password with NTLocksmith. Additionally information has an
annoying tendency of ending up in odd places that you may not
have expected, for example users may save data to a floppy
disk or email it to themselves at home so they can work on it
from there. Fortunately there are solutions to these
problems, however without user education and support from
management most will not be effective. </font></p>

<p><a href="20010910-writing-security-advisories.html">Writing
security advisories</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">I've been writing security digests now for
several months, for Linux and BSD. This means I read pretty
much every single vendor issued security advisory, along with
advisories for software packages on Bugtraq and other mailing
lists/websites/etc. I am happy to say that most Linux
distributions and vendors are doing a pretty good job on
their security advisories, but not all are perfect. A
security advisory is a complex thing to write properly, the
following items need to be covered (if applicable):</font></p>

<p><a href="20010924-apache-org.html">A Matter of Trust: How
Apache.org Was Compromised </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">As you've probably heard by now, Apache.org
was broken into last week, and the system was compromised.
How this happened is much more interesting then your usual
&quot;known hole in an old piece of software&quot; scenario
(although this was the final nail in the coffin for
Apache.org).</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Most break-ins we hear about are relatively
straightforward -- someone was running an unpatched copy of
IIS 5.0 or they forgot to upgrade their FTP server to a
recent version. These types of problems are relatively easy
to deal with, you keep software up to date, but they are
impossible to completely eliminate. At some point you have to
run software to make the system useful, and even the most
heavily audited and secured system will have bugs in it's
software. It is inevitable that at some point an attacker
will discover a problem and use it, or release code publicly
allowing anyone to exploit the flaw, and software vendors
will react, provide a fix, but this still needs to be applied
by system administrators.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">However, an old issue is becoming
increasingly problematic as more machines are placed online.
The problem is trust.</font></p>
