<p>I've been writing security digests now for several months, for
Linux and BSD. This means I read pretty much every single vendor
issued security advisory, along with advisories for software
packages on Bugtraq and other mailing lists/websites/etc. I am
happy to say that most Linux distributions and vendors are doing
a pretty good job on their security advisories, but not all are
perfect. A security advisory is a complex thing to write
properly, the following items need to be covered (if applicable):</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Name of the problem</li>
<li>Description of the problem, severity, etc.</li>
<li>Versions affected and not affected, configurations
affected and not affected</li>
<li>Workarounds for the problem </li>
<li>Solutions for the problem </li>
<li>List of software updates to apply </li>
<li>Where to get the software updates</li>
<li>How to apply the software updates</li>
<li>Patch code</li>
<li>Contact information in case you have more questions</li>
<li>URL for the advisory (i.e. FTP or WWW)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of other optional items such as credit to
whomever discovered the problem originally, came up with the fix,
and so on (giving credit costs nothing, and encourages people).
The advisory should also be signed securely, PGP or GnuPG are
good choices for this, X.509 signing is not such a good idea
since these advisories should be posted to web and ftp sites in
addition to mailing lists. Unfortunately most PGP signed
advisories that are emailed get sufficiently mangled (i.e. line
wraps) so when you check the advisories they say something like:</p>
<pre>*** PGP Signature Status: bad
*** Signer: Name removed to protect the innocent
*** Signed: 8/30/00 3:38:25 AM
*** Verified: 9/2/00 1:53:14 AM
*** BEGIN PGP VERIFIED MESSAGE ***</pre>
<p>And since many do not include a link to the advisory via FTP
or WWW most users will not bother to check the validity of the
advisory, it is only a matter of time before some adventurous
soul posts a fake advisory which people follow, loading trojan
code. This is especially true for non-vendor advisories, i.e.
advisories for the smaller software packages, for example Helix
Code issued a security advisory recently that was not PGP/GnuPG
signed. Hopefully if enough vendors follow these practices users
will become used to actually verifying the validity of security
announcements, and will not be as easily fooled.</p>
<p>This leads to my next beef. PGP/GnuPG keys, would it kill
vendors to have them signed properly and post them in an easy to
find location on their websites? Caldera is especially guilty in
this respect, I could not find their PGP key on their website,
and when I searched the keyservers I found several, but since
their keys are not signed by any other keys (self signed,
absolutely useless) it is of questionable value. Shame on
Caldera. Vendors should get together and at least sign each
others keys, and maybe get luminaries such as Linus Torvalds or
Werner Koch (author of GnuPG) to sign their keys. </p>
<p>The next problem area is advisory numbers. Most vendors put a
unique advisory number on each advisory, most use something along
the lines of:</p>
<p>vendor_id_sa-number-version</p>
<p>for example:</p>
<p>CSSA-2000-029.0<br>
MDKSA-2000:042<br>
RHSA-2000:047-03 </p>
<p>CS is Caldera Systems, MDK is Mandrake, RH is Red Hat and so
on, the SA stands for Security Advisory. The year is a really
good idea, whole number of course would be pointless without the
version number, and not having a revision number is highly
annoying when trying to figure out which is the latest (i.e.
correct) version of the advisory (DO NOT &quot;backport&quot;
updates to advisories and neglect to add a revision number, this
is a really bad idea). This information is <strong>CRITICAL </strong>for
your users, you need to make it as understandable as possible and
extremely easy to keep track of. Some vendors guilty of not using
advisory numbers include SuSE and Debian, with things like:</p>
<p>Update: the powerpc packages mentioned in the first release of
this advisory were linked with a version of libgtk that is not
available in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2. They have been recompiled with
the correct version and reuploaded. </p>
<p>Now for my all time favorite pet peeve. Not listing MD5 sums
in the advisory along with the software packages. It's trivial to
execute &quot;md5sum *&quot; and cut and paste that into an
advisory. Luckily most vendors include MD5 sums in their
advisories (and most of the smaller software packagers do not),
however in some cases the MD5 sums listed, and the actual MD5
sums of the software packages have been different (meaning
someone messed up while creating the advisory, or that the
packages have been replaced with different version on the ftp
site). Between most posted security advisories not being
verifiable by the PGP/GnuPG signatures, and the occasional MD5
sum mistake it is very difficult for users to verify packages. Of
course if vendors signed their packages it would basically be a
non-issue, currently many major vendors do not PGP/GnuPG sign
their packages, although SuSE and Mandrake should be doing this
in the next major release (and if they don't I will roast them). </p>
<p>There are often other problems with security advisories that
make them hard to read or interpret. One of the most annoying
things is to read a security advisory with spelling mistakes in
it. It really make me wonder how much care an attention was spent
on the security problem that is being talked about. Other issues
include listing updates &quot;messily&quot; i.e. when you have
multiple product versions with different updates and the full
pathname is either not given or not very descriptive. </p>
<p>Now this brings us to the last and final problem, no matter
how well an advisory is written, how technically accurate it is,
and how well it walks the user through the update, it is
absolutely useless if the user does not see it. Probably the best
method to get this information to users is to email it to them,
almost all Linux distributions have severity announcement mailing
lists that they post all their advisories to. Many also post to
lists such as Linux-Security-List and Bugtraq (the granddaddy of
security mailing lists). The advisories should also be posted to
a directory on your website and ftpsite, it requires a trivial
amount of effort, unfortunately many vendors do not place these
in an obvious place, and even more do not include a URL to the
WWW or FTP locations of their advisory. All in all most
distributions are doing a pretty good job, but with a few
improvements they could be doing a great job. </p>
<p>It should be interesting to see which distributions take this
article to heart and fix their advisories.</p>
