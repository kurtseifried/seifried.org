<p>Biometrics have garnered increasing attention and backing in
the last few years. We are promised a utopian existence: never
again will you forget your password or need to remember your
access card to get into the building. Unfortunately, it isn't
quite this simple. While biometrics will be a significant portion
of any authentication or identification in the future, they
cannot replace many existing security systems without significant
disadvantages. Using biometrics in conjunction with other proven
security methods can result in a stronger solution; but using
biometrics on their own is a very bad idea, for numerous reasons.</p>
<h2>Breaking Biometrics</h2>
<p>Like any security system, a biometric system can be
compromised. While many vendors make compelling arguments against
just this issue, it isn't unthinkable. Fingerprint scanning
systems (and by extension hand geometry readers) are relatively
old and can be based on any number of technologies, from simple
optical scanner to lasers, sonar, pressure-sensitive pads, and so
on. </p>
<p>Of these systems optical ones are probably the most
vulnerable. Because they rely simply on a camera to take a
picture of the ridges and bumps on your fingers, you can fake
some out with a simple black and white picture of a person's
fingerprints. For others, a latex mold of the finger is needed
&#151; a task that is far from being impossible. </p>
<p>Newer systems actually use a mechanism such as a laser to read
the actual surface of your finger, generating a detailed
three-dimensional map that can also detect the presence of a
pulse. Some go so far as to check for body heat. Hopefully
companies will choose a technology that is extremely hard to fake
out. For cost reasons, however, many will likely go with cheaper
optical solutions and the like. </p>
<p>The next step up would be using the eye as a source of
identification. Many systems utilize the blood vessel pattern on
the back of the eye, and some use features contained in the iris.
These systems are much harder to defeat, but it is only a matter
of time before someone can develop a sufficiently advanced fake
eyeball that fools detectors.</p>
<p>These systems also face some difficult acceptance problems.
People are afraid to stick their eyes up to something that has a
laser in it &#151; never mind that this laser cannot put out
enough power to damage the eyeball. I personally have had laser
eye surgery (Lasik in both eyes at the same time), and I am still
somewhat leery of sticking my eye up against something that can
scan it.</p>
<p>Voice recognition systems are also becoming popular. Unlike
the first two, they do not require you to stick your finger or
eye into anything, and they are extremely easy to use
(&quot;Please repeat the following sentence&quot;). Numerous
difficulties exist, though, since people's voices change
constantly: we get colds, get laryngitis, we mature over the
years, and so forth. </p>
<p>Voice generation is still sufficiently difficult that it will
not be possible for some time to generate another person's voice
very well. And recording someone's voice can be countered rather
simply by requiring the user to repeat a random phrase or list of
words. </p>
<p>Camera-based systems show promise. Not only can they recognize
your face, but if attached to your workstation they can
automatically log you out when you go to the bathroom and log you
back in once you return. These systems vary from simple optical
scanners to combinations of optical and infrared (and possibly
other wavelengths in the future). In theory, someone with a good
latex mask and wig should be able to fool these systems out;
infrared makes it more difficult, but probably not impossible.
This is another kind of system that is extremely easy to use
(please look at the camera for a moment).</p>
<p>Despite all these wonderful technologies, one simple problem
looms. At some point (probably sooner than we hope) attackers
will find ways to spoof your finger/eye/voice/face. Then the
question is, how do we fix it? Does the company upgrade all of
its biometric scanners to models that cannot be faked out? Or,
like the credit card companies, does it simply pass the cost of
fraud on to consumers in the form of higher rates?</p>
<h2>The Dishonest Merchant</h2>
<p>Skip forward 20 years. You're at the store paying for
groceries. You slide your smartcard into the machine, mash your
thumb on the pad and hit the large green Accept button. Money is
automatically moved from your account to the merchant's, and all
seems well. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, what you didn't notice is that the merchant has
made modifications to his fingerprint reader. Instead of just
scanning your thumb and using that to unlock the smartcard, it
has also recorded your thumb. Now, if the merchant can get ahold
of your smartcard, they can access it and clean out your account.
</p>
<p>This is currently possible with debit cards. It would be
reasonably trivial to make a fake keypad that records people's
PIN numbers. And since the debit card is just a simple magnetic
strip, it is possible to copy this strip when the card is swiped,
and load the data onto another card. </p>
<p>We haven't heard of much fraud of this type, however. The
number of people with debit card machines is restricted to
merchants, so if someone were to try this, it would become
quickly apparent who had the modified machine. However, as the
use of debit cards increases, we can imagine someone building a
fake vending machine. For example, you select what you want, feed
it your card and type your PIN in. This is all recorded, and then
the machine declines the transaction. </p>
<p>The above has happened in the past with fake ATM machines, but
because of their limited use, it is relatively easy to track
down. What happens when every single purchase we make uses a
debit card or some newer alternative? </p>
<h2>The Solution?</h2>
<p>Like any system, biometrics can be hardened and more layers of
security added, but this of course costs significant money. If we
had smartcards that need a thumbprint to unlock them, then
putting the reader on the card would solve many problems. But
this is bound to be more expensive than just rolling out
smartcards and giving merchants the thumbprint readers. </p>
<p>Use of strong PKI could help prevent replay attacks and fake
machines that try to get you to put in your PIN or give up a
thumbprint. If every merchant terminal had a unique individual
certificate signed by a trusted authority (such as the bank), and
your smartcard had the bank's public key and a red and green LED
light to let you know if the certificate was legitimate or not,
then fake terminals would be far more difficult to set up. </p>
<p>Using multipart authentication, a token plus a thumbprint plus
a PIN number, greatly increases the survivability of a system.
But these solutions cost money, and if credit cards are any
indication, then merchants and consumers seem willing to foot the
bill for fraud.</p>
