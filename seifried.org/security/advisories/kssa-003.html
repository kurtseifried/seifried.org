<p><strong>Title: </strong></p>
<p>Multiple windows file wiping utilities do not properly wipe
data with NTFS file systems. </p>
<p><strong>Issue date:</strong></p>
<p>Jan 21, 2002</p>
<p><strong>Who should read this advisory:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone using file wiping utilities such as PGP Wipe (from
NAI), BCWipe (from Jetico) or East-Tec Eraser (from East-Tec) on
a Windows system with an NTFS file system, such as Windows NT,
Windows 2000 or Windows XP especially with features such as
thumbnail pictures in explorer. This advisory affects virtually
every Windows file wiping utility, none of the tested programs
were found to be problem free. </p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>In the NTFS file system a facility exists to bind additional
data to a file or directory, called an alternate data stream
[url1][url2]. These alternate data streams cannot be be removed,
unless the parent file or directory is destroyed. Unfortunately
most file wiping utilities only deal with the primary data stream
and do not wipe the alternate data streams, thus leaving data
intact. </p>
<p><strong>Affected software:</strong></p>
<p>It is important to note that every single software package
tested failed to erase single or multiple data streams (Eraser
5.3 erased multiple data streams in, however missed alternate
data streams when only one was present in a file). Based on this
I find it unlikely that any other secure deletion programs
implement alternate data stream wiping properly, all secure
deletion programs for Windows should be treated as suspect until
proven innocent. If you are using secure deletion software please
check immediately for files with alternate data streams, and
after deleting them you are strongly advised to wipe all free
space. </p>
<p>BCWipe version 1.x and 2.x from Jetico - Confirmed in testing
and from vendor. <a href="http://www.bcwipe.com/">http://www.bcwipe.com/</a></p>
<p>Eraser 5.3 - Confirmed in testing and from vendor. <a href="http://www.tolvanen.com/eraser/">http://www.tolvanen.com/eraser/</a></p>
<p>SecureClean v3 build-2.0 - Confirmed in testing and from
vendor. <a href="http://www.accessdata.com/main_deleted_data.htm">http://www.accessdata.com/main_deleted_data.htm</a></p>
<p>East-Tec Eraser 2000 - Confirmed in testing. <a href="http://www.east-tec.com/eraser/index.htm">http://www.east-tec.com/eraser/index.htm</a>
</p>
<p>PGP 6.x freeware and commercial, 7.x, freeware and commercial
- Confirmed in testing. <a href="http://www.pgp.com/">http://www.pgp.com/</a>,
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/">http://www.pgpi.org/</a> </p>
<p>Numerous other packages are suspected to be vulnerable, it is
strongly advised to use the workarounds listed below. </p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<p>If data is stored in an alternate data stream attached to a
file (such as the thumbnail of an image) or directory when this
file or directory is wiped the information contained within the
alternate data stream will be left intact on the harddrive. No
warning is given to the user at all by Windows or the wiping
programs. For example if you use windows file explorer (the
default file browser in Windows) and have thumbnails of pictures
enabled (the default setting) then the thumbnail of the thumbnail
image, once created (i.e. once the directory is viewed in
Explorer) will not be deleted until you delete the file and wipe
all free space. Alternate data streams also provide an ideal
location to keep attack tools, snippets of virus code and so
forth for attackers and viruses, in fact some virus scanners do
not scan alternate data streams unless specifically configured to
do so (often labeled as &quot;scan all files&quot; or similar). </p>
<p>The good news is that floppy disks and most other removable
media are not formatted as NTFS, thus it is unlikely that copied
files will contain the alternate data streams. As well no all
compression programs, such as WinZip copy the alternate data
streams, while others such as WinRAR do copy the alternate data
streams. While it is unlikely that files with alternate data
streams will have made it to other systems with their alternate
data streams intact it is possible, and any systems that have had
sensitive data copied or moved to them should immediately have
their free space wiped in order to ensure alternate data streams
containing sensitive information are still present. </p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Details:</strong></font></p>
<p>Create a file with an alternate data stream:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>echo &quot;this is a text file&quot; &gt; C:\file.txt
echo &quot;this is the alternate data stream lkajhkl2&quot; &gt; C:\file.txt:alternate-data-stream</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you use forensics software to examine the harddrive you
will find the string of text &quot;this is the alternate data
stream lkajhkl2&quot; present on the drive. </p>
<p>Now using the file wiper of your choice (BCWipe, etc.) choose
the file C:\file.txt and wipe it. Use any many passes as you
want. </p>
<p>Now examine the drive for the string &quot;this is the
alternate data stream lkajhkl2&quot;. You should be able to find
it. To do this using Linux simply create an image file of the
drive and examine it using grep or strings:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=windows-disk.img
grep &quot;this is the alternate data stream lkajhkl2&quot; windows-disk.img</pre>
<pre>or</pre>
<pre>strings windows-disk.img &gt; windows-disk.strings
grep &quot;this is the alternate data stream lkajhkl2&quot; windows-disk.strings</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As you will quickly discover the data is easily found. </p>
<p>Alternate data streams are only available on NTFS file
systems, making home users with older systems (Windows95,
Windows98, WindowsME) immune to this problem, but newer systems
based on WindowsXP are capable of using NTFS, thus potentially
exposing customers to risk. NTFS is also available on most
corporate systems such as WindowsNT, Windows2000 and WindowsXP. </p>
<p>Another &quot;feature&quot; of alternate data streams is that
they cannot be deleted. If you have an alternate data stream
attached to a file you cannot delete it, you can write other data
to the stream, however you cannot reliably delete it. To
overwrite an alternate data stream simply place more data into
it, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>echo &quot;this will overwrite existing data in the stream&quot; &gt; C:\file.txt:alternate-data-stream</pre>
<pre>or</pre>
<pre>type notepad.exe &gt; C:\file.txt:alternate-data-stream ***</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solutions and workarounds:</strong></p>
<p>Several workarounds exist, and several vendors are in the
process of updating software so as to fix the problem. </p>
<p>The first workaround is to avoid using alternate data streams
to store sensitive information. To check for alternate data
streams several free tools exist, one of the best of which is
LADS [url3] from Frank Hayne Software (heysoft.de). Simply
download lads.zip and unpack it, then run it from your root
drives (e.g. C:\, D:\) and it should find and report any and all
alternate data streams present. Because alternate data streams
cannot be deleted tools to detect them are quite effective, once
found you should securely delete the files and proceed to the
next workaround, wiping free space, in order to ensure the
alternate data streams are deleted. </p>
<p>The second workaround is to immediately use the &quot;wipe
free space&quot; feature present in most secure file deletion
utilities. Since the parent file or directory that the alternate
data streams were attached to have been deleted the data in the
alternate data streams is now in &quot;free space&quot; on the
harddrive, thus using &quot;wipe free space&quot; will overwrite
it. The downside of this workaround of course is that wiping all
the free space on a hard disk can take quite some time,
especially on a modern disk that may have several tends of
gigabytes of free space to wipe. One note on this: wiping free
space may not be possible or effective on network shares using
NTFS, it is recommended to encrypt truly sensitive data on NTFS
network file systems. </p>
<p>A third workaround is to encrypt sensitive data, Windows 2000
offers encrypted file system, or you can use programs such as
PGP's PGPDisk [url4] or Jetico's BestCrypt [url5]. It is
recommended to use encrypted disk partitions rather then
encrypting single files, encrypted disk partitions are much
easier to work with, type in a password and you have access, when
you are done you do not need to worry about encrypting the file,
as the data is kept in an encrypted state on the hard drive.
Additionally temporary files stored in the same directory (such
as opened word files) will also be kept in an encrypted state,
reducing the need for you to wipe free space. </p>
<p>Several vendors have announced new versions in light of this,
see below for more information:</p>
<p>BCWipe 1.x and 2.x</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We confirm importance of the problem of wiping
alternate data stream in files, created on NTFS disks. We
would thank Mr. Seifried for writing us about the problem and
are going to solve it in the next version 3 of BCWipe, which
is planned to be released at April, 2002.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SecureClean </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We will be covering all those issues in the next
release. We plan to be shipping the product in February. The
new release will be posted at www.accessdata.com. The current
SecureClean does not handle alternate data streams or the
thumbnails. That is coming in February.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>East-Tec Eraser 2000 </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;EAST Technologies has acknowledged the possible
problem concerning the wiping of the alternate data streams
that may appear on NTFS disk drives and it will analyze this
problem in the security product that it develops and the way
this may compromise the user's personal security and privacy.
EAST Technologies will also inform all its users and
customers and in case it would be necessary, it will develop
a fix.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eraser 5.3 ***</p>
<p>PGP 6.x and 7.x ***</p>
<p><strong>Additional information:</strong></p>
<p>Check your anti-virus software, several packages do not scan
alternate data streams by default, it is recommended you enable
scanning of all files and confirm by placing the eicar.com [url6]
in an alternate data stream of a file and scanning to test.
Backup programs should also be checked, attach an alternate data
stream to a file, delete and then restore it, check for the
alternate data stream. You can remove an alternate data stream
either by copying the parent file onto non NTFS media or backing
it up with a program that does not save the alternate data
stream, or by using the &quot;rm&quot; utility present in MKS
Software's &quot;MKS Toolkit 8.0&quot;. An op-ed piece on this
problem will be appearing at SearchSecurity [url7] later this
week. </p>
