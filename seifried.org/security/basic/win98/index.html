<p>So you are using Windows 98, and want to secure your machine,
but aren't quite sure where to start. Well you have come to the
right place. This guide will lead you through a 4 step security
process, the first step is to install anti-virus software, the
second step is disabling services you do not need on your
computer (but were probably enabled by the manufacturer), step
three consists of updating your windows software, and finally the
last step is installing a personal firewall. Throughout this
guide I use free products as examples for the simple reason that
they are the quickest to get ahold of and install. You are
encouraged by all means to purchase commercial products, they
typically provide a much higher level of support then free
products, and are sometimes easier to work with in the long run.
However in the scheme of things free security software (such as
an anti-virus software package) is much better then nothing.
Unfortunately during the process of securing your machine you
will have to reboot several times (this is a &quot;feature&quot;
of windows, most changes require a reboot). I suggest you either
bookmark this page, or save it to your harddisk. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Installing anti-virus software</h2>
<p>Unfortunately there are no longer many free anti-virus
software packages for Windows. While virtually every anti virus
maker offers a free trial version these typically expire after 30
days, leaving you unprotected. I strongly advise you purchase
anti virus software, especially if you use email (which is where
a majority of infections come from). New viruses like SirCam are
especially bad, they go through your computer looking for files
and email addresses and then send copies of your files to random
email recipients. I personally have received several hundred
sensitive documents from numerous people, ranging from tax
returns to personal correspondence. Fortunately there are still
several free solutions, AVG and Housecall.</p>
<p>AVG is available from: <a href="http://www.grisoft.com/html/us_downl.cfm">http://www.grisoft.com/html/us_downl.cfm</a>
to all non Europeans (although UK residents can get it for free).
There is no support, however the package does provide real time
support and cleaning. If you are not in Europe and unable to
purchase anti-virus software I strongly recommend you download
and install this software.</p>
<p>Housecall is from Trend Micro, available at: <a href="http://housecall.antivirus.com">http://housecall.antivirus.com</a>.
It provides an online web based software package that can scan
and clean your system of viruses. Unfortunately because it is web
based you must visit the web page to run it, and it does not
offer real time protection. In other words you could easily
receive a virus via email that would be able to delete files or
otherwise damage your system, and Housecall would not protect
you. </p>
<p>If you wish to purchase anti-virus software there are several
large companies that provide solid anti-virus solutions:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mcafee.com/">http://www.mcafee.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.norton.com/">http://www.norton.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sophos.com/">http://www.sophos.com/</a></p>
<p>After installation of your anti-virus software you will
typically need to reboot, unfortunately you are not yet finished,
as you will probably also need to update the anti-virus software
and reboot once more. This step is critical, there are several
nasty viruses currently circulating and unless you update your
anti-virus software you will not be protected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Disabling services in windows</h2>
<p>There are several services in windows often enabled by
manufacturers that most home users do not need. Part of the
functionality that windows offers is network file sharing and
printer support. If you only have one machine chances are you do
not need these features. The other major feature is Windows
network login. This login screen prompts you for a username and
password, this username and password DO NOT restrict access to
the machine however. The username and password are simply cached
so that if you were to try and access a network file server your
machine would try these credentials first, and if they were valid
you would not be prompted for them (saving you from having to
type in your username and password each time you access a file).
Enabling windows printer and file sharing can allow an attacker
to gain access to your machine, and the same goes for Windows
network client. Installing these components and enabling them is
the default in Windows, so unless you specifically disable or
remove them they will be present. With these software component
installed a remote attacker can find out a lot about your
computer. By querying your machine remotely they can learn your
login name and your workgroup name and the hardware address of
your computer (which can give them enough information to know
what brand of computer you own!):</p>
<pre>nbtstat -A 10.3.0.1</pre>
<pre>	NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table

Name			Type	Status
---------------------------------------------
WORKSTATION0	&lt;00&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKGROUP1	&lt;00&gt;	GROUP	Registered 
WORKSTATION0	&lt;03&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 

MAC Address = 00-60-82-F8-F4-93</pre>
<p>Workstation0 is the name of the workstation, and Workgroup1 is
the name of the workgroup. With Windows file and print sharing
enabled the remote attacker can find out even more information:</p>
<pre>	NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table

Name			Type	Status
---------------------------------------------
WORKSTATION0	&lt;00&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKGROUP1	&lt;00&gt;	GROUP	Registered 
WORKSTATION0	&lt;03&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKSTATION0	&lt;20&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKGROUP1	&lt;1E&gt;	GROUP	Registered 
USERNAME	&lt;03&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKSTATION0	&lt;1F&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 

MAC Address = 00-00-D2-E8-F2-53</pre>
<p>They now have your username, and can connect to any shared
files or printers you posses. If you do need to share out files
and printers you should install a personal firewall so you can
restrict who has access.</p>
<p>Click on &quot;Start&quot; &gt; &quot;Settings&quot; &gt;
&quot;Control Panel&quot; and then choose &quot;Network&quot;:</p>
<p><img src="../images/win98/control-panel-network.jpg" width="366" height="458"></p>
<p>Then select &quot;File and printer sharing for Microsoft
Networks&quot; and click remove, and then do the same for
&quot;Client for Microsoft Networks&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Updating windows software</h2>
<p>This is extremely easy in Windows 98. Simple click on the
&quot;Windows Update&quot; link on your menu or type in the
following URL in Internet Explorer:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>From there a small applet loads and does an inventory of what
you have installed, and which version, then the items you need
are displayed on a webpage, in descending order of importance
(Critical security fixes first). You then click on the item, and
download and install it, some fixes have to be installed on their
own, and some you can install several at a time. </p>
<p>You can also go to the above corporate URL if you wish to
download the fixes and save them which is extremely useful if you
have more then one Windows 98 machine. The URL for this is:</p>
<p><a href="http://corporate.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp">http://corporate.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp</a>
</p>
<p>You should visit these sites at least one a month, or to
automate the task simply install the &quot;Windows Critical
Update Notification&quot; component (available on the update page
under &quot;Picks of the month&quot;). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Installing a personal firewall</h2>
<p>If you do need to offer services such as file and print
sharing to other machines then a personal firewall can allow you
to restrict who is able to connect. As well any software you
install that provides network services or tries to use them will
be proactively blocked, so you can easily block spyware packages
from sending back information and so on. My personal favorite for
this is ZoneAlarm, it is freely available for home use, very
effective and very easy to configure. You can get it from: <a href="http://wcarchive.cdrom.com/pub/flood/zonalm26.exe">http://wcarchive.cdrom.com/pub/flood/zonalm26.exe</a>
or <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/zap26_za_grid.html">http://www.zonelabs.com/zap26_za_grid.html</a>.
