<hr>
<p>It's funny to see the Internet sneaking up on businesses and
becoming a critical component, without many people seeming to
realize it. Many businesses now rely heavily on email as a
messaging system, the use of web servers to distribute corporate
data and allow access to a variety of services. All these
services rely on DNS. DNS is the directory to the Internet, it
maps names such as seifried.org to IP addresses such as 1.2.3.4.
To see a fortune 100 company, such as Microsoft, suffer a
multi-day outage because their DNS infrastructure is not up to
the task is disturbing indeed. </p>
<h2><strong>DNS Security and availability</strong></h2>
<p>In the past we've run several articles on DNS security, and by
and large most organizations have begun to pay attention to these
issues and address them. However a significant part of security
is availability. While preventing an attacker from accessing
sensitive data is definitely a security goal, allowing an
attacker to deny access to that resource, for everybody, can be a
significant problem. Even if your webservers are in tip-top
shape, the firewalls are doing their job, and your backend
application servers and databases are in perfect order it doesn't
matter if an attacker manages to take out your DNS servers.
Without DNS servers no-one on the Internet will be able to find
your servers, would you be able to remember 199.81.203.50,
153.2.228.50 or 56.0.78.101? Of course not, but you can remember
fedex.com, ups.com and usps.com. Worse yet without your DNS
servers internal services may not work properly, email deliveries
can fail and access to servers will timeout as DNS queries fail.</p>
<h2><strong>How DNS works</strong></h2>
<p>The first step is to contact a DNS registrar such as Network
Solutions and pony up $35 for a DNS name (good for one year). If
you forget to pay your registration fees your DNS name will be
taken out of the database and DNS will stop working (this has
happened to Microsoft in the past). So make sure you document
somewhere when your DNS fees need to be renewed. While you can
pay up to 10 years in advance I would not recommend it, making
DNS renewal a yearly ritual is probably better then leaving it
for 10 years (at which point your contact with the Internic may
have retired) and hoping that the reminder gets to the right
person.</p>
<p>Once this is done you can register up to 6 DNS servers for a
domain name. NetBSD for example has six servers listed, if five
fail in some manner DNS queries will still work (albeit slowly,
since clients will have to try several servers before finding the
working one). This is your first line of defense against an
attacker, since hopefully no attacker will be able to take out
all the root servers you can use them to do limited load
balancing, but more importantly to list multiple servers. </p>
<p>The DNS client will then query one of the DNS servers listed
by the Internic, so having numerous servers spread out (different
locations, backbone providers, etc.) will provide a good degree
of redundancy. The cost to host several machines at a major
co-location provider to host DNS services is trivial compared to
the cost of having an extended outage for most organizations. At
a bare minimum you'll need a 1U rack mount server with enough ram
to handle the database in memory (in most cases 512 megs will be
plenty), you may additionally want to place a firewall in front
of it to prevent attacks directly on the firewall. </p>
<p>By having several sets of DNS servers at different provides a
much more robust system, an attacker must take out more then one
target, however if all your DNS servers are running at 100%
capacity and an attacker takes one server out that may cause
enough added load on the other server to make them unresponsive.
Ideally a single server should be able to handle the full load,
realistically you should be able to lose at least one, and
probably two servers without overloading the remaining servers.
Microsoft, like a wounded gazelle, was attacked, most likely the
chokepoint router was targeted, which would have the effect of
blocking access to the four DNS servers behind it. It doesn't
matter how powerful and fast and well secured those four DNS
servers were, the router in front of it was most likely dead
(traceroute response was very sporadic).</p>
<p>Below is a table listing public information about various
major companies DNS configuration. This information was gleaned
by using:</p>
<pre>whois <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f19489909c819d94df9e8396b186999e9882df829e9c9481839e8798959483df929e9c">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>
dig -t ns example.org
traceroute foo.example.org</pre>
<p>Microsoft has made some serious improvements in their DNS
configuration, by dint of outsourcing some of it to Akamai, how
is extremely experienced at this sort of thing (oddly enough the
Akamai server handling Microsoft's DNS appears to be running
Linux). I also expect to see Microsoft do some reorganization of
their own servers in the future. The following companies rely
very heavily on the Internet, from providing simple product
information to product updates, critical security fixes, and so
forth. In general they are doing a good job, most have DNS
servers in three or more separate locations. This chart reflect
data from Jan. 31 of 2001. </p>

<p>Two vendors stand out as having particularly poor DNS
infrastructure. Caldera by far has the worst, with only two DNS
servers hosted at the same site, in fact this is the site that
hosts most of their servers, email, ftp and so on. Essentially
they have a network link to their offices with all their
infrastructure based their, if someone were to flood a router on
that link they could likely take out Caldera entirely (DNS,
email, secondary email, ftp, etc.). Another vendor with a poor
DNS infrastructure is Mandrake, while not nearly as bad as
Caldera it is far from perfect. Mandrake appears to host two DNS
servers with Level3 (a major provider), and while it is unlikely
they can be simply flooded, it appears that they are not
firewalled from the Internet, meaning that an attack on the DNS
server themselves is possible (they are running several services
not related to DNS on the servers). </p>
<p>And neither of these companies are alone, according to an
article in TheRegister (URL below) about 25% of fortune 1000
companies are vulnerable in similar ways to Microsoft (and
Caldera / Mandrake). However as you can see from the table it is
possible to do it correctly, many major companies (such as IBM
and Novell) as well as mid sized companies (Red Hat and SuSE) and
even several free community efforts (such as OpenBSD and NetBSD)
have solid DNS infrastructure. This is not a network task that
should be put off, if you do not have DNS servers in at least two
(or preferably three or more) separate locations then you should
start on this immediately. While I do not advise completely
outsourcing your DNS (the provider may not have properly secured
DNS servers, etc.) co-locating machines at a major ISP is a
reasonable solution. One thing to remember is that zone transfers
are not encrypted, so some form of VPN (such as IPSec) is
recommended to secure the path between your primary DNS servers
and backup servers. It can be done properly, and should be done
properly, because your companies reliance on the Internet is not
going to decrease anytime soon.</p>
