<P><B>February 2, 2000</B> - Denial of service attacks are a part of
life on the Internet. They are generally speaking the easiest attacks
to commit since they require minimal skill, only a minimum of
knowledge about your intended victim's network, and can be done
relatively anonymously. Businesses and their customers are beginning
to rely on the availability of corporate web servers to conduct basic
business tasks, such as collaborating on projects, retrieving email
securely, checking the status of their pension fund, and so on. The
deployment of virtual private networking technology, much of it based
upon IP Security (IPSec) is also starting to accelerate, making it
possible for businesses to link various sites, traveling employees,
and customers together securely and cheaply. As people rely more
heavily on these services, they will become an attractive target for
malicious people, potentially disrupting large numbers of users and
services.</P>
<P>SSL provides authentication mechanisms for the proving of identity
as well as encryption services for data. The problem is that unlike a
traditional service (say telnet or ftp) there is a relatively high
overhead on the encryption and decryption required to talk to other
parties. Flooding a traditional HTTP webserver with say 50 bogus
requests a second won't bother most servers (for example
SecurityPortal.com recently got slashdotted, site traffic suddenly
jumped but the servers managed to make it through), however flooding
an HTTPS (SSL enabled) webserver with 20 requests per second can
quickly bring it to it's knees. Processing an HTTPS based request as
opposed to an HTTP request can require up to 10 times (and sometimes
more) the CPU time, due to the decryption that takes place. Even if
you require secure digital identification (using a client based X.509
certificate for example) of the party requesting a document from your
secure website there is still significant overhead in figuring out if
the request is kosher or not. Even with hardware crypto accelerators
for SSL, a determined attacker can still flood a server into the
great beyond.</P>
<P><EM>&quot;QuickSpecs: Compaq AXL200 Accelerator PCI Card<BR>The
Compaq AXL200 Accelerator PCI Card is the performance solution for
secure application servers. It supports more than 200 secure sockets
layer (SSL) connections per second. [Adobe Acrobat]&quot;</EM></P>
<P>This is one of the latest, greatest cryptographic accelerator
cards to be released, and it only supports up to (let's be charitable
and say 300) 300 connections per second, even with a server farm of
say 20 servers, an attacker would only have to generate 6000 requests
per second to flood your e-commerce site (or whatever you are using
it for) into the dirt. You might be wondering at this point &quot;how
is an attacker going to create 6000 bogus SSL connections if SSL is
such a CPU hog?&quot; the simple answer is: (s)he doesn't have to.
They can simply create a few bogus SSL packets and send them
repeatedly, or simply flood the server with garbage packets which it
will try to decrypt (and fail at). Unfortunately you can't block
these bogus requests, since the attacker will simply start spoofing
their packets as from large proxy servers and customer machines that
you want to talk to.</P>
<P>It gets worse, too.</P>
<P>I personally rely on IPSec to link my servers (hosted in one
location) to the LAN in my apartment, because of the IPSec link I can
safely check email, transfer files, do online backups, and generally
access my servers as if they were local to me. Unlike many companies
employing VPN technology my network is very small (2 locations), and
very heavily secured. The primary problem with IPSec is the
authentication mechanism. Currently the standard is IKE (Internet Key
Exchange) involves a daemon to communicate with other IPSec enabled
computers, typically using port 500, UDP. Some people like me are
lucky, and can firewall access to that port heavily (although
figuring out which IP's I allow wouldn't be too hard, and then you
could spoof them). Most sites will not be so lucky, having to support
large populations of users and remote sites - possibly with dynamic
addresses, means the ability to firewall access to the IKE daemon
will be severely limited. IPSec can make use of cookies (small
authentication tokens), which reduces the amount of damage a flood
attack would cause, but does not fix it completely. Some initial
testing of random UDP packet floods against an IPSec server indicate
a denial of service attack should be quite effective. Again there are
hardware based cryptographic accelerators but these will only
alleviate the problem somewhat, a determined attacker will be able to
flood the server and the resulting CPU usage will result in an
unusable server. You could (in theory) use manual keying of IPSec
tunnels and not use any key management, but this is unworkable in
anything other then a small environment, and would decrease the
security provided by encryption significantly.
</P>
<H5>So what can we do?</H5>
<P>Probably the best thing you as an administrator can do, right now,
is to make sure your firewall rules prevent spoofing. If all networks
had outgoing firewall rules that prevented any packets claiming to
come from networks not actually at that location, the ability to
trace attacks would be significantly easier. Additionally by having
outbound filters you stand a much better chance of detecting
malicious users and compromised hosts internally, and the odd
misconfigured host. If you have a high requirement for security I
would advise against using the Internet, frame relay is a lot better,
and dedicated lease lines are best (but hideously expensive), and if
an attacker is sufficiently motivated they will rent a backhoe and
buy some blueprints. Some firewalls (like IPF) will let you block
small mangled packets, which is another technique attackers can use
to <B>a)</B> sneak the packets past many firewalls, and <B>b)</B> use
server resources, while it tries to put the packets together (i.e. it
will wait for fragments that never show up).</P>
