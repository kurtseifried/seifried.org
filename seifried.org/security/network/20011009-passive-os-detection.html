<p>Passive OS detection is an increasingly useful technique.
People want to generate statistics on who's connecting to their
machines, and administrators want to determine what is attacking
them. The beauty of passive OS detection is that avoiding or
faking it out takes a reasonable amount of work and expertise,
and most won't bother. There are a variety of packet fields that
can be used to identify the remote OS; TTL field, window size,
don't fragment and so on. This is largely due to the fact that
while TCP/IP stacks are interoperable, there are major variations
in the way they handle various details that are set in the packet
headers.</p>
<p>Last week I covered Linux, and more specifically its default
behavior in relation to the ports it uses for the source of
outgoing connections. This raised an interesting question: Can I
reliably detect what the remote OS is, based solely on the source
port of the connection? </p>
<p>The default behavior of Linux with respect to local ports is
extremely predictable. Within the kernel there is a setting for
the local port range:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c</pre>
<pre>/*
* This array holds the first and last local port number.
* For high-usage systems, use sysctl to change this to
* 32768-61000
*/
int sysctl_local_port_range[2] = { 1024, 4999 };</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to change this behavior, you can change the kernel
source code, or modify the local port range via the proc
interface:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>echo 6000 8000 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It increments by one for each outgoing connection. IP-MASQ'ed
connections are handled similarly, starting at 61000, and
incrementing steadily.</p>
<p>Windows 9x and NT 4.0 behave very similarly, starting
connections with port 1024 and steadily incrementing it by one
for each outgoing connection. I was not able to find anything in
the registry or the MS knowledge base, so I assume - to assume is
all I can do - that it is hard coded into the OS somewhere. As
far as I can tell there is no way to modify this. (If there is, I
would love to know about it.) Solaris 8.0 on an Ultrasparc seems
to start around port 32860. I suspect it starts somewhere around
half of 65535 (hard to nail down exactly), and it steadily
increments by one. </p>
<p>If you get a connection from a port near 1024 (your average
client won't initiate more than a few hundred connections an
hour), you cannot be sure if it is Linux or a Microsoft platform,
or can you? You can drastically increase the confidence of your
tests by observing other portions of the packet. According to a
page by Lance Spitzner, Windows sets the TTL on packets to 32 or
128, and Linux uses 64. Considering how few people modify this
default behavior, it is a reasonably sure way to tell the
difference between Linux and Windows. Also, if you look at the
window size - the sliding TCP/IP window - Windows 9x and NT use
the second smallest window size on average (HP Jet Direct uses a
smaller window). Linux uses a much larger window size. With all
the various differences between TCP/IP stacks, you can be near
100% of what OS a packet originated from - assuming the remote
machine hasn't been significantly modified. And doing so is
relatively inexpensive, computationally. </p>
<p>Additionally, you can use active OS detection techniques. The
way in which operating systems respond to various IP packet
options, ICMP packets and so on, results in an almost guaranteed
correct identification of the remote end. As an extension of
passive fingerprinting, for TCP connections, you would be able to
send arbitrary packets to the remote end, which would most likely
not be firewalled, since they appear to be part of a legitimate
connection. What is more, these packets could be injected by a
machine other than the server handling the connection. (Although
tricky, this wouldn't be impossible.)</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for administrators trying to defend
their networks? Well, if you want to, you can reliably identify
the OS that is connecting to your machines, without the remote
end knowing that this is happening. This will allow for an extra
layer of defenses. By allowing only Windows-based machines to
connect to your exchange server, for example, you would
potentially block attackers using Unix platforms, as is common
nowadays. There doesn't even need to be any integration on the
host server. Using various &quot;features&quot; - flaws,
depending on your point of view - there are several tools that
can be used to kill TCP connections on a local LAN. Perhaps
something for the Snort/Arachnids people to work on (using
Sniffit or HUNT). </p>
<p>Network security is constantly evolving, and new nooks and
crannies are being discovered every day. Sometimes these
&quot;features&quot; can be used in new and unintended ways, and
while I wouldn't recommend betting the farm on securing your
network with passive OS fingerprinting and TCP connection
killing, it might be a useful security addition for some
networks. That, and using things in unintended ways, can result
in unexpected problems; on the other hand, it can also be fun.</p>
