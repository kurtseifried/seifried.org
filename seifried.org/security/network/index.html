<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>I come not to bury Suidnet, but to praise
it. Well, that is not entirely true - there are still some
significant problems with Suidnet, but it looks to be the start of
something good. I wouldn't be surprised if you haven't heard of
Suidnet. It's an effort by IRC and security enthusiasts to create a
more secure IRC network. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="20020305-ddosfaq.html">Denial of Service (DoS) FAQ</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>This FAQ covers denial of service attacks
(DoS) in great depth, and has links to software that can be used to
execute DoS attacks, we do not condone or encourage the use of this
software, however we feel that since the &quot;bad people&quot; (or
just curious people) can find it easily, we might as well tell you
where it is. Also, reviewing the DoS attack code can be helpful in
assisting you in finding evidence of compromised systems,
particularly if you do not have security scanning packages.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A HREF="20010926-ftp-protocol.html">Problems with the FTP
protocol</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>FTP used to be the king of the Internet, if
you wanted to download something you went to your favorite ftp server
or used Archie to find the file. Even today the number of ftp servers
is staggering, and many ftp sites contain several hundred gigabytes
of online archives (take a look at your local sunsite). FTP was built
to be an extremely flexible protocol, and therein lie many of it's
problems. The FTP protocol not only allows you to transfer files from
an ftp server to your machine but from one ftp server to another ftp
server directly. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="20011009-passive-os-detection.html">Passive OS Detection
and Source Ports</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Passive OS detection is an increasingly
useful technique. People want to generate statistics on who's
connecting to their machines, and administrators want to determine
what is attacking them. The beauty of passive OS detection is that
avoiding or faking it out takes a reasonable amount of work and
expertise, and most won't bother. There are a variety of packet
fields that can be used to identify the remote OS; TTL field, window
size, don't fragment and so on. This is largely due to the fact that
while TCP/IP stacks are interoperable, there are major variations in
the way they handle various details that are set in the packet
headers.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A HREF="20020324-dns-servers.html">DNS server infrastructure</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>It's funny to see the Internet sneaking up
on businesses and becoming a critical component, without many people
seeming to realize it. Many businesses now rely heavily on email as a
messaging system, the use of web servers to distribute corporate data
and allow access to a variety of services. All these services rely on
DNS. DNS is the directory to the Internet, it maps names such as
seifried.org to IP addresses such as 1.2.3.4. To see a fortune 100
company, such as Microsoft, suffer a multi-day outage because their
DNS infrastructure is not up to the task is disturbing indeed. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="firewall/20011025-firewalls-evolve-or-die.html">Firewalls
- it's time to evolve or die</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>I come not to praise firewalls but to tear
them apart and expose their soft underbelly. However a disclaimer
first: even though there are many problems with firewalls and they
are far from perfect you are probably better of leaving them in, they
are better than nothing most of the time. In some cases they are
about the only major line of defense for many networks (more on this
particular issue later) so please do not remove your firewall without
some serious thought. I hope I am being clear enough, if you still
think I am advocating the removal of firewalls stop reading now and
please do not email me. </FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>There was a time (believe it or not) when
firewalls were a pretty new concept, and many people thought that
only the government, military and other paranoid organizations would
ever use them. However the Internet expanded at a furious rate and
all sorts of people become connected, many of whom have hostile
intentions. Add to this the sheer number of network services on most
networks now (file and print sharing, user authentication,
interactive services, email, web, etc.) and there are plenty of
network services to be exploited and abused. There are two primary
types of firewall currently in use, network and application.
Firewalls are good at many things, and also very poor at others.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A HREF="20000202-future-dos-attacks.html">Future Denial
Of Service Attacks</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Denial of service attacks are a part of life on the Internet. They are generally speaking the easiest attacks to commit since they require minimal skill, only a minimum of knowledge about your intended victim's network, and can be done relatively anonymously. Businesses and their customers are beginning to rely on the availability of corporate web servers to conduct basic business tasks, such as collaborating on projects, retrieving email securely, checking the status of their pension fund, and so on. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
