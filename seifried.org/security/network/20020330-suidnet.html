<hr>
<p>I come not to bury Suidnet, but to praise it. Well, that is
not entirely true - there are still some significant problems
with Suidnet, but it looks to be the start of something good. I
wouldn't be surprised if you haven't heard of Suidnet. It's an
effort by IRC and security enthusiasts to create a more secure
IRC network. IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. You have servers
linked together, and they relay what people are saying, so that
you can have 50,000+ people logged in to multiple channels (or in
AOL speak &quot;rooms&quot;), all talking about various topics. A
lot of people use IRC to discuss reasonably sensitive topics -
just like they use email - from personal things such as medical
problems to generic discussion about what a twinky the new boss
is. It is trivial to monitor what a person says on IRC through a
variety of means, making it very similar to email: Don't say
anything you wouldn't mind your mother/wife/competitor seeing. </p>
<p>Suidnet has started this process by allowing people to connect
to the servers using SSL-enabled IRC clients (or SSL tunneling
software). This is a good start; it prevents local snooping on
the user, and would be effective in a business environment where
users may be monitored, or a shared computer lab on a university
campus. The data moving between servers is also encrypted,
preventing widespread snooping by one party with access to a
machine in the path between servers. Unfortunately, a determined
snooper can monitor what a user is up to online. Admittedly, it
will take more effort, but it is far from impossible. As I see
it, there are currently three primary problems with Suidnet, all
of which will take a significant amount of effort solve.</p>
<h2><br>
Self-signed Certificates</h2>
<p>The first issue is the SSL certificates used on the servers -
they are self-signed, and improperly at that. Using the default
settings in OpenSSL for certificate creation, they have created
certificates for the server &quot;localhost,&quot; which is fine
for local testing but inexcusable for anything going into
production. This is the certificate information:</p>
<pre>Name:
localhost, Stunnel Developers Ltd, Some-State, PL
Issued under:
Stunnel Developers Ltd
Serial number:
00
Validity:
Thu Feb 10, 2000 to Fri Feb 09, 2001
Fingerprint:
C9:88:A5:3F:27:31:B8:1F:21:FB:95:A6:5A:10:4E:89</pre>
<p>The certificate is completely and utterly useless. It is
trivial for me as a business to redirect dns for irc.suidnet.org
to an internal server, and then set up stunnel on port 9999 and
direct it to the real servers. Users would then be directed at
this &quot;proxy,&quot; allowing me to monitor what they are
doing with ease. What Suidnet needs to do is create a certificate
authority, with a protected master certificate in a safe location
that is used to sign the server certificates (a process identical
for Web server certificates). Even if Suidnet were to do this
properly - which is unlikely, since properly creating and
maintaining a certificate authority takes quite a bit of work -
it would be pointless without the root certificate being shipped
in IRC clients.</p>
<p>The theory behind why SSL secures connections is simple.
Certificates are signed by a root certificate (Thawte's or
Verisign's). The public key portion of this root certificate can
be used to verify the signatures, and this public key is shipped
with the software. If an attacker is able to fiddle with the key
that ships with the software package, they can also fiddle with
the software package, rendering any security ineffective. This
whole method of securing connections relies heavily on the client
installing a &quot;trusted&quot; client that contains the public
portions of the root keys. Now to fix this, they would need to
work with the creators of popular IRC software such as Epic IRC
or BitchX, or possibly create their own packages and distribute
them on a secure Web server. Since the client has to trust the
server not to be logging everything, Suidnet says it is feasible
for them to distribute the client software as well. Hopefully
Suidnet will fix this shortly. </p>
<h2><br>
Server Security</h2>
<p>This is the next area that Suidnet appears to be having
significant problems with. If the server is not secure, then an
attacker can break in and modify the software so that they can
monitor what is going on. A quick audit of the Suidnet servers
showed almost every server running at least 2 or 3 services,
ranging from ssh, dns and ftp to samba (windows file sharing),
mysql, X11, portmap and NFS. On the server with NFS available, I
was able to connect and query it - not exactly an encouraging
sign, especially when you consider the number of software flaws
present in Linux and the various BSDs. It doesn't do much good to
write secure software and then run it on servers where an
attacker can likely gain root-level access remotely. If Suidnet
is serious about security, the only thing the servers should be
running is the IRC software, and SSH for remote access. Not pop,
X11 (yikes) and samba. They definitely need to cut down on the
number of services available, and the number of user accounts. </p>
<h2><br>
Human Security</h2>
<p>This one is by far the hardest to deal with in many ways. A
really determined attacker can simply set up a server and ask to
join the Suidnet IRC network. It would then be relatively easy to
fiddle with the server software so that the cleartext messages of
users are logged to a database or some similar feature (or he
could simply copy the private SSL certificates to another
machine, snoop all the network traffic and decrypt it with the
certificate). No matter how much technical security goes into
assuring that the IRC software running on the server has not been
tampered with (self-verifying software and other neat tricks) the
attacker possesses the private certificate and can easily decrypt
all network traffic. Even if the server administrator is not
given this information, and some trusted Suidnet member logs in
to initialize the software, the attacker can copy it out of the
machine's memory (this is much easier than previously thought)
and use it to decrypt traffic. This issue boils down to carefully
vetting server administrators and making sure they are
trustworthy. </p>
<h2><br>
Suidnet Says...</h2>
<p>I also got a chance to interview one of the primary people
behind Suidnet, David N. Hulton (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c9ada1bca5bda6a789a7afbaaee7a6bbae"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="17737f627b637879577971647039786570">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></a>). The good
news is they seem aware of the current problems and are working
on them. Security is an ongoing process that never ends. </p>

<td valign="top">We found it too difficult to be able to
talk to one another encrypted (for exchange of passwords
and personal information mainly) and found that there
wasn't much out there that could accommodate what we

much more users on the system besides us.</td>

<td valign="top">We have no plans to do anything of the
sort. The only degree of anonymity that we are offering
is that we do not, and never will do, any ident checks.
We still feel that hostnames and usernames should be kept
to provide enough information so you can actually tell
who you are talking to. I personally would want to have
some way to verify who I'm talking to before giving out
any information.</td>

have a plan to deal with this should it come to your
attention?</td>

<td valign="top">A:</td>
<td valign="top">We are merely providing the facility to
talk to other people with the least possibility of

Besides that and IRC encryption, there aren't any other

<h2><br>
Summary</h2>
<p>Security is a holistic practice. You can't just plug one hole
and expect all your problems to be solved. No matter how perfect
a technological solution you use (encryption, firewalls, etc.),
as long as there are humans involved mistakes can be made. People
you thought you could trust turn out to be hostile in intent. If
Suidnet is serious about running a secure IRC network, then they
have made only the first few steps in what will be a long
journey. But as the famous saying goes, &quot;A journey of 500
miles starts with half a step.&quot; I hope that Suidnet will
complete the journey, and inspire others to do so. We need more
people to focus on making secure network services.</p>
