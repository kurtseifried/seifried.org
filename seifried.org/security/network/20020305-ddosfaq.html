<p>This FAQ covers denial of service attacks (DoS) in great
depth, and has links to software that can be used to execute DoS
attacks, we do not condone or encourage the use of this software,
however we feel that since the &quot;bad people&quot; (or just
curious people) can find it easily, we might as well tell you
where it is. Also, reviewing the DoS attack code can be helpful
in assisting you in finding evidence of compromised systems,
particularly if you do not have security scanning packages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><a name="1.0">1.0 What are Denial of Service (DoS) attacks?</a></h5>
<p>Denial of service attacks are simple and usually quite
effective. An attacker attempts to overwhelm a service with
requests, similar to a 5 year old constantly tugging on his
mother's sweater while she is trying to have a phone
conversation, you can only do so many things at a time. For
example if you have a mail server capable of receiving and
delivering 10 messages a second an attacker simply sends 20
messages per second, chances are the legitimate traffic (as well
as a lot of the malicious traffic) will get dropped, or the mail
server might stop responding entirely. Typically attackers will
go for high visibility targets such as the web server, or for
infrastructure targets like routers and network links. </p>
<h5>1.1 What are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks?</h5>
<p>If using one computer to launch an attack against your target
works, well using 50, or 5,000 computers is probably going to
work that much better (and enable the attacker to go
&quot;elephant hunting&quot; for things like Yahoo!). It also
allows the attacker to take a step or more back from the actual
machines executing the attacks, making it more difficult to trace
them. </p>

<h5>1.2 Is a DoS/DDoS Attack a threat to sensitive data?</h5>
<p>DoS and DDoS attacks typically do not pose a direct threat to
sensitive data. Usually the attacker is trying to prevent a
service from being used, not actually compromise it. However a
DoS/DDoS attack may be used as a diversion while another attack
is made to actually compromise systems. Additionally
administrators are more likely to make mistakes during an attack
and possibly change a setting that creates a vulnerability that
can be exploited. Services may need to be stopped or restarted,
and if this is done incorrectly problems can be created, when
modifying your network make sure you understand the effects of
what you are doing (which may be different then normal while
under attack).</p>
<h5><a name="2.0">2.0 Who commits DoS/DDoS attacks, and why?</a></h5>
<p>There are far too many reasons to even have a remotely
comprehensive list, but I will list a few anyway to give a quick
overview.</p>
<h5>2.1 Curiosity</h5>
<p>Some attackers are only testing or playing with tools they
have downloaded and do not actually realize the amount of damage
they can create.</p>
<h5>2.2 Malice</h5>
<p>Some attackers disagree with corporate policies, or color
scheme used on the website, and attack the site for no real
reason. Think of it as a simple act of vandalism similar to
someone spray painting &quot;NARF NARF&quot; on the side of your
building.</p>
<h5>2.3 Financial gain</h5>
<p>This is a real potential nightmare, for example a company
might be attacked to delay the launch of an online service, or to
discredit it. Attackers might be paid by a competitor, or are
attempting to manipulate a stock price.</p>
<h5><a name="3.0">3.0 Are the attackers likely to be caught, and
what are the penalties for DoS/DDoS attacks?</a></h5>
<p>It is hard to say - most attackers are not highly skilled, but
their tools are good at concealing identities. They may possibly
be caught through a combination of painstaking auditing and cross
referencing of log files and someone bragging or squealing on
IRC. The FBI press conference on February 9th mentioned possible
penalties of up to 5-10 years incarceration.</p>

FBI press conference</p>
<h5><a name="4.0">4.0 How can I protect my systems and networks
from DoS/DDoS attacks?</a></h5>
<p>Generally speaking good security practices are the best long
term protection. Disabling all unnecessary services, keeping
software up to date, and subscribing to various email security
lists will help. Having a current list of contact names and
numbers for emergencies will be especially useful during an
emergency. Thre is no one thing you can do to stop DoS/DDoS
attacks (i.e. no &quot;Anti DoS attack verion 1.0&quot; software,
despite what some vendors claim). </p>

<h5>4.1 Protecting the border's and gateways</h5>
<p>The extremeties of your network are usually the most
accessible to an attacker, and the best choke points to attacks
(most sites will have one link to the Internet, take that down
and you have effectively taken down any services offered by that
site). There are a number of measures you can take to protect
your external routers, basic firewalling precautions (such as
blocking spoofed addresses and so on) and protecting the
mechanism used to broadcast and receive routing information (i.e.
BGP, OSPF, and so on).</p>
<p><a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2267.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2267.txt</a></p>
<p><a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2644.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2644.txt</a>
</p>
<h5>4.2 Protecting Internet servers</h5>
<p>Disable any unneeded services and make sure the software is up
to date. If possible place at least one firewall in between the
server and the Internet, this way if there is an attack on the
server you can probably block it at the server. Realistically if
the attacker is determined they can flood your bandwidth and
there is nothing you can do on your end to &quot;fix&quot; it.
The key for most sites is to filter the traffic before it gets to
your links, which means having your ISP firewall attcks, this may
not be possible if the attack comes from enough different sites
(i.e. it is impractical to add 10,000 firewall rules). </p>
<h5>4.3 Protecting internal servers and clients</h5>
<p>Firewall them heavily, no external hosts should require access
to internal hosts on your network. If external hosts do require
access you should consider Virtual Private Networking (VPN) to
provide secure access to your internal LAN.</p>
<h5>4.4.1 Cisco routers</h5>

<h5>4.4.2 Linux</h5>
<p>Linux has support for firewalling software and most Linux
distributions ship with it. IPCHAINS (the current firewalling
software) can easily block various hostile packets, and can
easily be setup to prevent the machine from spoofing (i.e. a
university lab with Linux workstations). For more information on
IPCHAINS, and various utilities to make configuring it easier
please see:</p>
<p><a href="../../lasg/firewall/index.html" target="_top">/lasg/firewall/index.html
</a></p>
<p>You can also prevent IP spoofing from a machine very easily by
enabling source address verification vi the rp_filter facility.
From the IPCHAINS-HOWTO, miscellaneous section:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash
# This is the best method: turn on Source Address Verification and get
# spoof protection on all current and future interfaces.
if [ -e /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter ]; then
  echo -n &quot;Setting up IP spoofing protection...&quot;
  for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter; do
      echo 1 &gt; $f
  done
  echo &quot;done.&quot;
else
  echo PROBLEMS SETTING UP IP SPOOFING PROTECTION.  BE WORRIED.
  echo &quot;CONTROL-D will exit from this shell and continue system startup.&quot;
  echo
  # Start a single user shell on the console
  /sbin/sulogin $CONSOLE
fi</pre>
<p>Create this file as /etc/rc.d/init.d/rp_filter (or wherever
appropriate) and then enable it at boot time by creating a
symlink to it, or calling it in the network startup script.
Hopefully in future vendors will add this as standard and enable
it by default. The IPCHAINS-OWTO is available at:</p>

<h5>4.4.3 Windows 95 / 98</h5>
<p>Unfortunately Windows 95 / 98 has no real built in protection
against attacks, however there are several add-on products (some
free) that will protect you against most common threats. Please
do not take these listings as an endorsement, we are simply
listing various options available.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/download_ZA.htm" target="_top">http://www.zonelabs.com/download_ZA.htm</a> - Zone

<h5>4.4.4 Windows NT 4.0</h5>
<p>Windows NT 4.0 does have built in firewalling however it is
not 100% reliable and we would not advise relying upon it as your
only security measure. There are of course several third party
firewall proucts for NT, </p>
<p><a href="http://www.networkice.com/Download/PURCHASE.HTM" target="_top">http://www.networkice.com/Download/PURCHASE.HTM</a>
- Network ICE's &quot;BlackICE Defender&quot; is $39.95 US, it
will work on servers but you will need to configure it to allow
access (by default lit blocks most things). Network ICE is
releasing a server version this year that will cost $50 US to
upgrade to, or $139.95 US to purchase. </p>

<h5>4.4.5 Windows 2000</h5>
<p>Windows 2000 (recently released) has pretty good built in
firewalling capabilities (a lot better then NT 4.0). These are
appropriate for end user machines and small to medium sized
servers, for a larger server you may want to consider a third
party add on product. The firewalling configuration is done via
the Microsoft Management Console tools, and can be configured
remotely (of course be careful when doing this as you could
easily lock yourself out of the machine).</p>
<h5>4.4.6 OpenBSD</h5>
<p>OpenBSD ships with PF which is a really nice stateful packet
filter (free to). More information on PF is available at:</p>

<h5><a name="5.0">5.0 How can I prevent my systems and networks
from being used for DoS/DDoS attacks right now?</a></h5>
<p>Firewall any unneeded services, turn off any unneeded
services, this will reduce the number of services that can be
attacked. As far as actually preventing an attack from succeeding
the best you can do is buy the most powerful servers you can
afford, and tune the software (while under attack if necessary)
to handle as many connections as possible. Reducing the timeouts
on connections to services will decrease the effect of a flood
somewhat, but legitimate connections may fail as well. </p>

<h5><a name="7.0">7.0 How do I detect a DoS/DDoS attack directed
at me?</a></h5>
<p>An unusually large amount of traffic, servers suddenly
experiencing above average loads, all these can be signs of a
DoS/DDoS attack, on the other hand it might represent a high
usage peak. In any event you should examine the traffic and usage
patterns, if the traffic is legitimate then you will probably
want to tune your network and servers, or add additional
equipment, if the traffic is an attack then you will need to deal
with it accordingly. There are a number of Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (NIDS) which can detect hostile attacks with a
pretty good degree of accuracy, they may are a good investment if
installed and maintained properly.</p>
<h5><a name="8.0">8.0 What should I do if I am the target of a
DoS/DDoS attack?</a></h5>
<p><a href="http://www.sans.org/y2k/DDoS.htm" target="_top">http://www.sans.org/y2k/DDoS.htm</a>
</p>
<h5><a name="9.0">9.0 How do I detect a DoS/DDoS attack
originating from me?</a></h5>
<p>One of the more effective methods is to have filters on your
firewall to block outgoing traffic that does not originate from
your network (spoofed data). If you find this type of traffic
hitting the firewall you can be relatively sure that internal
hosts are being used for malicious purposes. Trace the data back
to its origin, which should not be too difficult since (in
theory) the network is under your control, and then depending on
your security policy you might take the machine offline and
examine it. Another effective method is to block the commonly
used ports (like 37337) that are used to remotely control
compromised machines. In addition to this I would advise scanning
your network for open ports on a regular basis using tools such
as nmap or saint, any changes should be investigated and
appropriate action taken. Also there is a good network scanner
called Nessus which will detect most common vulnerabilities, it
is very easy to use (built on a client server architecture with
Windows and Java clients available), and free. The newer DDOS
programs however do typically not respond to scans, so scanning
the network for open ports is primarily useful for finding the
old tools, and for finding potential security holes in machines
on your network.</p>

<h5><a name="10.0">10.0 What should I do if I am the origin of a
DoS/DDoS attack?</a></h5>
<p>This heavily depends on your network security policy. You may
for example wish to ultimately prosecute the offender, in which
case you will need to take great pains to preserve the chain of
evidence. </p>
<p>If you wish to stop your systems from being used to launch
attacks you should not just reboot them and remove the agent. You
will also need to plug any and ALL security holes, otherwise the
intruder will break in again in short order. Assuming you cannot
patch all the machines then you should try to limit access to
them in other ways, by firewalling them off for example.
Unfortunately in many environments (especially &quot;public
ones&quot; like educational institutions) even updating all the
software and making sure the mchines are secure against network
attacks will not always be 100% effective.</p>
<p>You should install software on all your important network
machines and ideally on every single host that can detect changes
and additions to the filesystem. This will allow you to hopefully
nip attacks in the bud (i.e. you notice one machine has been
compromised, and you can start taking corrective action) or for
after the fact clean-up when trying to find out how widespread
the penetration is.</p>

<h5><a name="12.0">12.0 DoS/DDoS attacks, software and counter
software</a></h5>
<p>There is a lot of DoS/DDoS software available on the Internet,
and several organizations (including the FBI) have helped create
and distribute software to counter it. Several Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (NIDS) are capable of detecting these attacks,
and of detecting remote usage of this software on your network. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sans.org/giac.htm" target="_top">http://www.sans.org/giac.htm</a></p>
<h5>12.1 Smurf</h5>
<p>Smurf is one of the older DDoS attacks, and was one of the
first to be widely publicized. It simply consists of sending a
forged ICMP packet (that appears to be from the intended victim,
i.e. 1.2.3.4) to the broadcast address of another network
(6.7.8.255 for example), every machine on the remote network (so
say 100 machines) all reply, to the victim. This has the effect
of amplifying the attackers bandwidth, especially when you start
pinging network addresses where hundreds of hosts respond. Smurf
works because people do not configure their routers and/or
firewalls correctly, there is no sane reason to need to send a
broadcast ICMP packet to a remote network. Broadcast ICMP pings
are useful on local networks, for determining which IP addresses
are actively in use and so forth, but broadcast traffic should be
blocked at the router and/or firewall. Simply add a firewall rule
blocking traffic to your network address at the firewall and/or
router - this is typically a relatively simple operation. If you
want to see if a network is susceptible to being used to amplify
ICMP pings simply visit one of the following websites, enter your
network address and you will receive an answer quickly.</p>

<h5>12.2 Trinoo</h5>
<p>Trinoo is an older and somewhat simpler DDoS tool compared to
the current crop. It is more advanced than the older generation,
in that it uses password based authentication to allow access,
these passwords are simply crypt()'ed and compiled in, and you
can determine whether the binary on a machine is a master binary
or a slave binary using a technique described in Dittrich's
paper. If you find a master binary chances are there is also a
list of controlled hosts, which can be useful for assessing the
degree of penetration of an attack. Trinoo uses unencrypted
communications between the &quot;masters&quot; and
&quot;daemons&quot; and typically uses ports:</p>
<pre>1524 tcp

27665 tcp

27444 udp

31335 udp</pre>
<p>for communication, making it somewhat easier to find. In
addition if you run crack on the crypt()'ed password in a daemon
binary you can monitor the network for that keyword and detect
when the attacker is sending orders to the daemon (this is useful
if you are pursuing an investigation and want to track the person
down for prosecution).</p>

<h5>12.3 Tribe Flood Network</h5>
<p>TFN was written mostly as a proof of concept by a german
hacker (in the traditional sense of the word) to demonstrate how
vulnerable most networks are (guess what, he's right).
Unfortunately this tool was used in a series or large scale
attacks against large e-commerce sites which resulted in a large
amount of press and political activity (Mixter has since been
arrested on unrelated charges in Germany). TFN uses a client /
server approach, an attacker compromises a large number of
machines and controls them through intermediaries, the control
packets are labeled as ICMP_ECHOREPLY, which is typically allowed
through most firewalls, and the commands themselves are 16 bit
numbers (compiled into the program so they can be arbitrary).</p>

<h5>12.4 TFN2K</h5>
<p>Tribal Flood 2000 is one of the more advanced denial of
service software packages available. It runs on almost every form
of UNIX and has been ported to Windows (so almost the entire
Internet is potentially usable). It supports a number of attacks,
SYN flooding, UDP floods, ping floods and broadcast ping floods
(see Smurf for information on this last attack). All
communications between the various components (handler and
attacker nodes) is encrypted with the CAST-256 algorithm, and
then Base 64 encoded, so the content of control packets basically
looks like random ASCII characters. Control is via UDP, TCP and
ICMP packets, one way only (the attacker nodes do not respond to
the handler nodes and the handler nodes do not respond to the
master). These features (encryption, multiple types of control
packets, and one way communication make it difficult to detect
and block). There are several minor flaws with the way the
packets are created however, allowing them to be detected with a
relatively good degree of success. Since this program was ported
to Windows it is especially useful due to the enormous number of
insecure Windows clients on Cablemodem and ADSL networks (and
corporate/university networks).</p>

<h5>12.5 stacheldraht</h5>
<p>stacheldraht is a continuation of trinoo and TFN, it uses TCP
and ICMP for control messages between the handler and attacker
nodes. One major advance is the ability to upgrade the program
remotely, stacheldraht deletes the current file and downloads a
new one via rcp from a remote site (realistically rcp should be
blocked at your perimeter firewalls since rcp is not a very
secure way for moving files around the internet and is probably
not used in any case). Like the others there are signatures that
can be used to detect the data, and a perl program is available
to detect an agent, assuming it has the default configuration
(with the source code for stacheldraht and attacker could change
this).</p>

<h5>12.6 shaft</h5>
<p>Shaft is essentially a continuation of the Trinoo, TFN and
Stacheldraht denial of service programs. It does have several new
features however, it can switch handler servers (machines that
take commands from a master and then issue them to all the attack
nodes) and it can switch ports, making it harder to detect.</p>

</p>
<h5><a name="13.0">13.0 Who do I contact if I am attacked or an
attack originates from me?</a></h5>
<p>If you are being attacked the best person to contact
immediately would be your upstream network provider (whoever you
pay for bandwidth), they can help you trace the attack down,
and/or block it (they in turn will probably contact their
upstream provider, etc.). You might also try contacting the site
from which the attack originates, however this can be difficult
due to time zone differences, language differences, and so on.
When contacting the remote site do not use email, there is a
chance their email server and computer network may be fully
compromised, instead find their phone number and call them (this
is more likely to get a response as well). You can use whois to
list the contact information for domains and network blocks, for
example if you wanted to contact example.org (a fictitious
domain):</p>

<h5><a name="14.0">14.0 What is in the future for DoS/DDoS
attacks?</a></h5>
<p>The existing denial of service programs will get more
sophisticated, as attackers learn from the mistakes of others,
and various discussion forums distill the information gained.
Recently an email trojan went around, it was simply a VB Script
program, and it spread like wildfire. In the future someone may
write a relatively &quot;stealthy&quot; virus that installs
attack software on the windows client and possibly tries to
infect other hosts via email. This method could easily infect a
huge number of hosts for a short amount of time, with a steady
&quot;decay&quot; rate as people cleaned up their systems,
however the window of oppurtunity would exist to flatten many
sites (ironically enough if anti-virus vendors and popular forums
for alerting users about these problems were attacked it could
probably &quot;survive&quot; for a while). Unfortunately people
do not seem to be learning from these widespread infections
(Melissa, then ILOVEYOU several months later)</p>
<p>More attacks at emerging services is a likely bet. We have
already seen this with major attacks against e-commerce sites
(but not against the e-commerce technology specifically). With
the growth of encryption online (secure web server, IPSec, etc)
there will likely be more attacks against them, especially with
the high CPU overhead associated with encryption. Granted there
are hardware cryptographic accelerators that can easily handle
high loads, they are quite expensive, and simply shift the weak
link in the chain somewhere else. I also suspect there will be
more attacks against services that provide authentication, such
as PKI and LDAP servers, as the effect of &quot;taking out&quot;
a major authentication provider would be felt by many people and
be extremely disruptive to businesses (this would be similar to
attacking root DNS servers for example). </p>
