<h2>Firewalls - overview, add-ons and alternatives</h2>
<p>A firewall is generally something that separates things and
protects them from each other. Traditionally used in building to
help contain fires and prevent their rapid spread the modern
firewall is a computer running software that allows it to filter
information passing through it. A firewall can work at several
layers of the network, the highest level being application, and
generally the lowest would be the datalink layer (MAC hardware
address). Most firewalls operate at the network and transport
layer, they examine the TCP-IP data packet and then usually make
a decision based on the IP it came from, the IP it is going to,
the port it came from, the port it is going to, or any
combination of these. You can also look at the header options and
block based on those. Rules typically follow the lines of
&quot;let anything connect to the mail server on port 25&quot; or
&quot;block access from anywhere to any port from 1 to
1024&quot;. Firewalls working at the application level can filter
based on content, checking for viruses, keywords, and so on. </p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>There aren't to many alternatives to firewalls, by definition
something that blocks traffic is generally classified as a
firewall. While there are different levels of firewalls
(applications, packet, etc.) they are all related closely in
actual function, they take the data, inspect it, and then decide
whether to pass it or not, and some &quot;packet mangling&quot;
may take place as well (i.e. rewriting header information).
Because of this design they share a common set of problems. All
firewalls run an OS, usually UNIX based (such as FreeBSD or
Linux) although NT can be used as well, which is (hopefully)
stripped down (thus reducing the number of potential problems),
and integrated with the OS, or sitting on top of it is a firewall
package. The problem with this is all modern OS's have far more
features and capabilities then most firewalls require, and many
vendors of add on firewall packages such as Firewall-1 do not
force the user to strip down the OS (meaning many admins do not).
The result of this is there are numerous possible attacks against
most firewalls, NAI's Gauntlet actually had a flaw that allowed
remote attacker to gain full control of the firewall. </p>
<p>Beyond simple firewalling are firewalls that can require
authentication (in the form of a username and password, or token
based system) before allowing the user access. This way you can
easily restrict who is allowed to access what services. This is
important since basing access on IP is insecure, you can simply
unplug a machine with a &quot;trusted&quot; IP address (say an
administrators workstation), and then use that IP address on your
own machine and have elevated access. The use of authentication
also allows for tracking of user activity (be warned this is
illegal in some countries/states, and generally speaking you must
inform employees that they are being monitored). </p>
<p><strong>Proxy servers</strong></p>
<p>In addition to firewalls you can use a proxy server. If you
force all users through a proxy you can more easily control
content and filtering. For example by firewalling all outbound
access to port 80 (the world wide web) and forcing users to go
through a proxy server you can log what they are accessing,
control access to it (for example lock out stock trading sites
from 9am to 12am, and 1pm to 5pm, allowing them to trade after
hours or during lunch). MS proxy is a decent example of a proxy
server with good access controls (to note it is being replaced
with Internet Security &amp; Acceleration Server), you can allow
access based on the userid, and protocol, so for example everyone
in the company might be given www access, but only the
administrators and tech support people are given ftp access, and
no-one is given access to IRC. You can easily log all connection
and object requests, allowing for analysis of the logs (keywords
such as &quot;sex&quot;, or competitors names, usage, and so on).
You can set up pre-fetching for heavily used sites, for example
management might rely on a number of news sites (such as
news.com, and cnn.com) and you can enable pre-fetching which will
retrieve the document before people actually request it (and when
they do it will be available immediately). </p>
<p><strong>Beyond firewalls</strong></p>
<p>To compliment firewalls a new breed of product is now
available. One such example is Whale Communication's
&quot;Airgap&quot; technology, an appliance sits in-between the
two networks and uses shared memory technology to transfer the
data between the networks. Basically one server writes the data
to the shared memory, the shared memory is then disconnected from
that server, connected to the other and read. For all intense
purposes it maintains a physical barrier between the two
networks, but in such a way that moving data between the two is
very fast and has a low latency (imagine someone swapping floppy
disks between two machines really quickly). In addition to this
the internal host can apply a variety of filtering to the data, a
set of API's is available allowing you to build your own filters,
or use pre-defined ones. Allowing only data for example that
consists of 12 numbers, 20 alpha numerics and 4 more numbers in,
and then a yes/no out would allow you to clear credit card
numbers, and block pretty much any attack (exploiting a buffer
overflow would be near impossible for example). Generally
speaking these systems are not to expensive, a single Airgap
appliance is about $50,000 US, far less then the cost of most
security incidents. </p>
<p><strong>Intrusion detection</strong></p>
<p>In addition to using firewalls to block attacks you can use
intrusion detection systems to detect attacks and react to them.
At some point you will have to let data into your internal
network (otherwise why bother having an internet connection at
all). No matter how heavily you firewall (even if you deny all by
default) it is still possible for attacks to get through. By
monitoring the content of data you can detect attacks in
progress, compromised machines behind the firewall sending out
spurious data, and so on. Modern IDS systems typically consist of
multiple monitoring stations connected to central servers that
analyze the data, thus if an attacker probes for a weakness
through one link, and then tries to exploit it via another there
is a much better chance they will be detected. There are even
companies that will handle the entire process for you, placing
monitor stations at your location(s), collecting and analyzing
the data, and providing assistance on how to deal with the
attacks/etc. If you are on a tight budget there are OpenSource
alternatives, snort and arachnids are one useful combination. </p>

<h2>Firewall placement</h2>
<p>Security is no good if it isn't in the right place. Think
about a modern office building, where are the doors with locks?
The lobby doors can always be locked, and usually the doors on
each floor have locks as well. If only the office doors had locks
then it would take a lot more effort to secure the building (i.e.
many more locks would be needed) as well as security guards to
make sure no-one is trying to force a door. In a perfect world
every door would have a strong lock and a guard sitting next to
it with a shotgun, but since cost is a factor this won't happen.
The same applies to networks, while there are many free firewalls
available the cost of installing and maintaining a firewall on
each machine would be high, it is much more efficient to have
firewalls where your network connects to untrusted networks. As
well you should consider the type of traffic a firewall will need
to handle, the more traffic it must handle the more complex the
rules will need to be, and the greater a chance an attacker can
slip in. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Before or after?</strong></p>
<p>It goes without saying that your internal LAN should have a
firewall between it and the Internet. But what about servers that
won't work properly unless machines on the Internet can connect
to them? An Internet connection with no capacity for incoming
email, would be very Spartan indeed (web servers and DNS are also
usually hosted on-site in most cases). If you place the email
server behind the firewall, on your corporate LAN then you must
&quot;poke&quot; holes in the firewall to let email in. If an
attacker manages to compromise the mail server then there is
nothing between it and your internal LAN to slow down further
attacks. If you place the Email server in front of the firewall,
you can easily set up firewall rules to allow internal LAN hosts
to connect to it and send/retrieve email. If an attacker
compromises the mail server they will not be able to access the
internal LAN, since there is a firewall. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="images/firewall1.jpg" width="195" height="168"> One the attacker has gained
access to the Public server they can easily attack the
internal LAN</td>
<td valign="top"><img src="images/firewall2.jpg" width="134" height="189">Attacker will have less problems
attacking the public server, but cannot use it to attack
internal LAN as easily</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In-between</strong></p>
<p>For the best of both worlds you need two firewalls, on in
front of your public servers, and one in-between the public
servers and the internal LAN. This setup is usually refereed to
as the &quot;DMZ&quot;, because the zone in-between the two
firewalls is untrusted and heavily restricted. Additionally you
can setup application proxies (such as www and ftp proxies), then
block outbound access from the internal LAN on the exterior
firewall and force all clients to go through your application
proxies (which can have anti-virus capabilities for example). The
DMZ should be a relatively &quot;quiet&quot; zone, any hostile
packets trying to enter it (from the Internet, or the Internal
LAN) should be blocked at either firewall, increasing the
effectiveness of any intrusion detection systems (there will be
less false positives). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td><img src="images/firewall3.jpg" width="408" height="161">An attacker would need to get through the
first firewall, and the second one to penetrate the
internal LAN</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the DMZ concept is far from perfect too. It is common to
have the public servers and the internal LAN served off the same
link and firewalls, increasing the amount and types of traffic,
and thus the complexity of the firewall rules. Ideally you would
have a path from the internal LAN to a DMZ with the public
servers that is only used for internal LAN to public servers
traffic (i.e. website updates, retrieving email, etc.). There
would be a second path from the internal LAN to another DMZ with
proxy servers for Internet services (i.e. WWW, FTP) that is used
for Internet traffic only. This would greatly reduce the
complexity, on the &quot;public&quot; DMZ the only traffic would
be services you provide, and on the &quot;internet access&quot;
DMZ there would only be outgoing traffic with few or no incoming
connections being required (the notable exception being FTP).
This of course would require 4 firewalls, and two completely
separate configurations, however the reduction in complexity
(especially for large sites) is probably worth it. Also since the
&quot;public&quot; servers are more likely to be attacked then
the proxy servers surviving attacks (especially if you had
separate Internet links for each) would be much easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of traffic</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking there are two types of traffic, inbound and
outbound (if you see traffic going sideways call me). Usually
incoming traffic will generate a response in the form of outgoing
traffic, and vice versa. Ideally you should place limits on what
ports foreign machines are allowed to connect to (i.e. locally
ports 25, 53 and 80 are ok), and limits should be placed on which
ports internal hosts can connect out to. This is very important
with the growth of trojan horses and other &quot;backdoors&quot;,
attackers can send infected email and in a matter of minutes an
entire corporation can be infected with a Melissa or &quot;I love
you&quot; type virus. Imagine if it carried a payload such as
Back Orifice 2000 (a popular Windows trojan) and was set to
connect out to a certain host, from which it would take commands
(such as &quot;send me the contents of C:\ My Documents&quot; or
&quot;log all keystrokes and email them to me&quot;). The cost of
cleaning up from such a problem, let alone any cost associated
with lost or stolen data, passwords and other sensitive
information is very high. By blocking (and logging) outgoing
connections you can detect improper usage of the network for
example outgoing connections to port 6667 would indicate a user
is chatting on IRC, and potential security breaches, or it might
be Back Orifice 2000 with the speak easy plugin broadcasting the
machine it just infected. Splitting the traffic load between two
firewalls (i.e. one for inbound and one for outbound) doesn't
make any sense since you won't be able to keep state for
connections. Splitting types of traffic (i.e. one for servers,
and one for the internal clients) does make sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>If protection isn't in the right place, it won't work. If you
push all your traffic through one firewall you will end up with a
very complicated ruleset and chances are it will have flaws. If
you use to many firewalls or segment the traffic improperly you
will create an administrative nightmare. One thing to remember,
security is <strong>not</strong> static. You should be evaluating
your firewalls, usage, complexity of the rules, maintenance
issues and so on, and make changes as needed (and make sure these
changes are logged and understood). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What to block</h2>
<p>Oddly enough this is something many people don't think about a
whole lot, in some cases you can simply deny everything and have
a few specific allow rules which results in a pretty tight
configuration. However it is more likely that you have specific
blocking rules and allow most other things. Also this is usually
based on port numbers (i.e. service) and destination, however
source is also very important. Even if you only allow a few
trusted IP addresses to say connect to your &quot;secret&quot;
web server, an attacker can still spoof packets, and so on. You
can reduce the risk by blocking IP addresses that are in
&quot;high risk&quot; environments, such as Universities, foreign
countries and so on (assuming of course you are not terribly
interested in talking to them via the Internet). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Foreign sites</strong></p>
<p>If your business is only concerned about North America for
example then it might make sense to heavily restrict access from
other countries such as Russia, and China. If you are securing
network sites that are not providing public network services
(such as WWW sites) then you should probably restrict access from
network blocks like 24.* (cablemodem providers, a favorite
jumping point for attackers). You may also wish to restrict
access to external sites, for reasons including content or
employee distractions. </p>
<p>For example by blocking access to login.oscar.aol.com
(152.163.242.24, 152.163.242.28, 152.163.241.120,
152.163.241.128) you can effectively cripple AOL Instant
Messenger (AIM) from working. If you wanted to block access to
Freedom network you would block outgoing connections to ports:
51102/tcp and 51112/tcp. </p>
<p>If you have specific software or services you wish to block
access to the best thing to do is install it on a test machine
(preferably behind a firewall). You can then run the software and
use &quot;netstat&quot; to find out who the machine is talking
to, and if there is a firewall in-between you can closely monitor
what it is connecting to and so on (add a logging rule for all
packets to or from that host).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Internal sites</strong></p>
<p>Chances are not all of your internal machines require access
to the Internet, and by blocking them you can head off problems.
Machines without Internet access cannot connect to
&quot;naughty&quot; sites, and trojan horse software running on
them cannot contact outside sites to report it is installed, or
send stolen passwords. Any machines providing services to
Internet users (such as DNS, WWW, Email) should b allowed access
to the Internet (otherwise they will not work), although you may
wish to restrict it, for example the mail server should only need
to reply to clients that initiate connections, and only establish
connections to other mail servers (port 25), there is no need for
the mail server to establish connections to machines on any other
port then 25. Thus if someone were to break into your mailserver
they would only be able to attack other machines on a single port
(port 25), instead of all 65,536 ports (and of course you would
be able to quickly detect this type of behavior). Web servers
should only need to answer queries to ports 80 (and 443 for
secure web), and generally speaking do not need to establish
outbound connections. By heavily restricting the outbound access
of machines you can significantly reduce your exposure, and
increase the chance of detecting a security incident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong></p>
<p>There are many services, thousands in fact. However some of
these services are so common, and so dangerous that they warrant
special attention. The most common problems are in what I call
network infrastructure protocols. Things that almost all networks
use such as DHCP, DNS, SNMP, LPR, NFS, SMB, which provide basic
network management, or services such as file and print sharing.
Generally speaking these do not need to be shared out across the
Internet, and if remote users do need access to them (such as
file and print sharing) they should be tunneled through a VPN
(such as IPSec) and not allowed to go out in the clear. </p>
<p>23/tcp - telnet, cleartext authentication and sessions, should
not be used (replace with SSH).<br>
37/tcp and udp - time, use ntp (Network Time Protocol) instead<br>
67/tcp and udp - bootp server, should only be used locally<br>
68/tcp and udp - bootp client, should only be used locally<br>
69/tcp and udp - tftp (Trivial FTP), should only be used locally<br>
79/tcp - finger, should only be used locally<br>
110 and 111/tcp and udp - POP2 and POP3, if remote users need
access use SSL wrapped POP or VPN<br>
143/tcp and udp - IMAP, if remote users need access use SSL
wrapped POP or VPN<br>
161/udp - SNMP, attackers love this protocol<br>
162/udp - SNMP-trap, attackers love this protocol<br>
177/tcp and udp - xdmcp (X Display Manager Control Protocol,
restrict access or VPN<br>
389/tcp - LDAP, restrict access or VPN<br>
512, 513 and 514/udp and tcp - various remote services and
logging, restrict access or VPN<br>
1812/tcp and udp - Radius, restrict access or VPN</p>
<p>And the list goes on and on. The decision tree should look
like this:</p>
<p>Can we firewall it completely? If yes do so.<br>
Can we restrict access to it to people via a VPN only (i.e.
IPSec)? If yes do so.<br>
Can we firewall it restrictively (i.e. to &quot;trusted
hosts&quot;)? If yes do so.<br>
Can we restrict access to it from &quot;risky&quot; sources (i.e.
Canadian colleges, China, the USA)? If yes do so.</p>
<p>Basically what is the most restrictive thing you can do, and
the service is still useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Common configuration problems</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many common configuration problems with firewalls,
ranging in severity and scope. By far the most common problems
relate to what should be blocked or allowed. This is often
problematic because needs change, you may need to allow video
streaming for example, and unless done properly the addition of
new firewall rules can seriously undermine the security provided
by a firewall. Before any changes are made to a firewall you
should sit down with whoever is responsible, and ensure they will
not have unintended side effects. I find the best way to do this
is to print out the rules and make sure the new rules fit
logically into the existing structure. For example my rules
typically start with rules to block private and non routed
network (like 10.*, 127.*, and so on), followed by ICMP related
rules, then I have rules that allow traffic in (like SSH, Email,
WWW and so on), and then depending on the security required I
block the first 1024 ports (which are usually the most
interesting ones), or I have a default deny policy. If I need to
add a new rule to let in secure WWW traffic for example I would
not add it to the front of the list, I would add it in the
section with the specific allowals. Adding it to the front of the
list would result in attackers being able to send packets to port
443 (secure WWW) from non routed addresses. If your firewall has
multiple administrators this can be especially dangerous. You
should sit down together and write out a document describing how
and why rules are in place, ideally this document should be
online so it can be referred to, and modified as needed (always
document changes!). </p>
<p>Another common problem is people not blocking broadcast
traffic on firewalls. Broadcast traffic almost never needs to be
passed through firewalls, and generally speaking traffic sent to
the network address should not be passed either (in general this
means anything ending in a 0 or 255 should be blocked, your
netmasks may be different so make sure it's correct). Attackers
will often try to use broadcast ICMP traffic to attack other
sites, this is called &quot;smurfing&quot;. By pinging your
broadcast address instead of one host responding, many hosts
respond, all they need to do is forge the return address, and
some unwitting victim gets blasted by your network. Windows
machines are also in the habit of sending out a lot of broadcast
traffic, the default installs of pretty much every Microsoft OS
results in it advertising it's name and any services it is
running, this is especially dangerous for NT servers. On a modern
network there should be very little broadcast traffic.</p>
<p>Firewalls should block certain network management protocols,
especially bootp/bootpc, SNMP and RPC based services. These are
services attackers will attempt to compromise because they are
almost installed, and in many cases they will not be configured
securely (i.e. SNMP community names of &quot;public&quot; or
&quot;private&quot; are far to common). Windows file sharing
should generally not be used across the Internet, blocking ports
135 to 139 (udp and tcp) at the firewall is often a good idea, if
people do need access to their files this should be done through
a virtual private network. Ideally the only things let into a
corporate network should be public network services like DNS,
Email and WWW (and even then they should only be allowed to a few
secured servers), and returning packets from client connections.
VPN technology has matured to the point where there is not excuse
not to use it to connect sites securely that need to transfer
sensitive information such as corporate files.</p>
<p>Management of firewalls is also often handled poorly. Telnet
and R services should never be used. Web based admin tools should
not be used unless they provide an encrypted link (i.e.
https://), or through a VPN. Telnet, R services and unencrypted
web sessions mean that the passwords and so on can be gathered by
an attacker, or if they are sufficiently skilled they can hijack
the connection and insert a few commands before it is dropped
(like flush all rulesets). Any management should be done from a
handful of highly secured workstations that are NOT equipped with
mail readers, web browsers or any unneeded software. There are
far to many security problems in today's mail readers, web
browsers and other application software. If an attacker is able
to seize control of the administration workstation they can run a
key logger, network sniffer or simply seize control of it with
programs like Back Orifice 2000. For day to day administration of
the firewall (i.e. service packs, updates, and so on) you should
install OpenSSH or the commercial version of SSH if it is UNIX,
and if it is NT based you should administer it locally or use a
remote administration tools that support the GUI (i.e. PCAnywhere
and VNC) in conjunction with a VPN package (not PPTP!). Another
secure method is to manage the firewall &quot;out of band&quot;,
i.e. use the serial console on a sparc/Cisco/etc., or PPP (or
similar) on an NT box, this allows you to completely disable all
network services on the firewall, including remote logins, making
it very difficult for an attacker to get in using them (since
they do not exist). Additionally when someone attacks your
firewall through a denial of service there is a better chance of
being able to login and correct it. If you decide to use a serial
console/PPP and a modem then make sure the modem is secured, the
best way is to enable callback support, this way an attacker
would need to go to great lengths to connect to it.</p>
<p>Firewalls are an extremely useful component in any network
security plan, they have gone from &quot;only the government
needs firewalls&quot; to &quot;what is the best firewall for my
home computer?&quot;. Unless they are setup correctly, and
managed correctly however they are worse then useless (you will
think you are secure when in fact you are not). </p>
