<p>FTP used to be the king of the Internet, if you wanted to
download something you went to your favorite ftp server or used
Archie to find the file. Even today the number of ftp servers is
staggering, and many ftp sites contain several hundred gigabytes
of online archives (take a look at your local sunsite). FTP was
built to be an extremely flexible protocol, and therein lie many
of it's problems. The FTP protocol not only allows you to
transfer files from an ftp server to your machine but from one
ftp server to another ftp server directly. </p>
<h3>PASV verses ACTIVE</h3>
<p>The FTP protocol actually uses two channels for
communications, a control channel and a data channel. The control
channel uses tcp port 21, clients connect to it from a local port
(on Windows for example this is between 1024 and ~5000 or so) and
then send and receive information. When you request a file it is
send over the data channel which can behave in one of two ways:</p>
<p>With active ftp the client specifies to the server how the
transfer will be done. The client chooses a local port and tells
the server to send data to it. The server initiates a connection
from port 20 to the client and sends the data. The problems with
this are numerous, the primary one being the firewalls must allow
incoming connections from port 20 to a large selection of ports
on internal machines. This allows attackers to easily scan
internal machines by initiating connections from port 20. </p>
<p>With passive mode ftp the client asks the server for a file
and the server specifies how the transfer will be done. The
server chooses a port (typically 1024 to ~5000, incremented by
one for each new connection) and then tells the client to connect
to that port and receive the file. This has one major advantages
over active mode ftp, since the client initiates the connection
you do not need to put holes in your firewall to allow incoming
connections. However there is a major disadvantage as well.</p>
<h3>pasvagg.pl</h3>
<p>pasvagg.pl was written by H D Moore of DigitalDefense, and
it's very elegant in it's simplicity. pasvagg.pl allows you to
steal files that people are trying to download from an ftp
server. Because the server opens a port and then waits for the
client to connect there is a windows of opportunity for an
attacker to connect and receive the files instead of the real
user. While several ftp servers do make sure that only the client
IP that requested the file can actually receive it, many do not.
pasvagg.pl connects to the ftp server, finds out how many
connections per second the ftp server is making, and then starts
connecting to ports higher up in an attempt to connect to them
before the real user does. This allows you to steal files without
having to know usernames, passwords or any other details, and can
be done randomly with a good chance of success. Unfortunately
there is nothing the client can do to protect themselves, it is
reliant on the server to protect data transfers. </p>
<h3>The solution?</h3>
<p>There are several possible workarounds:</p>
<p>The FTP server could remember which host requested the file
and only allow that machine to download it, unfortunately this
breaks the FTP standard according to various FTP related RFC's
(this is because of multi-homed hosts). However breaking the
standard will not affect the majority of hosts since they are not
multi-homed (i.e. they only have one network interface). </p>
<p>The FTP server could use active mode ftp, however this will
not work through many firewalls since the server must initiate
the connection, so the server will no longer be able to talk to
many clients.</p>
<p>Lastly the FTP server can choose random ports instead of
incrementing them by one for every connection. This will make
life for an attacker significantly harder but it is still
possible for an attacker to guess a port and grab files before
the real client gets them (and if the attacker can continually
try several dozen or hundred ports they are virtually guaranteed
to grab files).</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no easy solution that will solve all
problems without either breaking standards compliance, or
creating other serious problems.</p>
<h3>Other attacks</h3>
<p>Probably the most popular FTP attack in past was the FTP
&quot;bounce&quot; attack. By misusing the PORT command an
attacker could use an ftp server to connect to other machines.
This allows for all sorts of malicious activity from simple port
scanning to moving files around. One program that makes use of
this is the Nmap port scanner, using the bounce attack it can use
an ftp server to proxy the scan, making it harder to trace back
and possibly avoiding firewalls in some configurations. Other
common problems include misconfigured FTP servers that allow for
people to upload and download files from the same directory, thus
turning your ftp server into a global /tmp directory for people
to share data with each others (usually &quot;warez&quot;). This
of course ignores all the root hacks that have been found over
the years in various ftp daemons (including OpenBSD's). </p>
<h3>FTP alternatives</h3>
<p>With all these problems in the FTP protocol and various FTP
servers one wonders if it's worth trying to fix at all.
Personally I think FTP is great for public downloads, i.e. things
like software distribution. I do not think FTP is a suitable
solution when authentication is required, or the files being
transferred are at all sensitive. Luckily several solutions
exist, two of which I use:</p>
<p>Rsync is excellent for doing large data transfers and
synchronizing large data structures (like ftp sites). If you need
to mirror an ftp site this is often a preferred method, and can
easily be used over SSH. </p>
<p>The SSH protocol has several ways for transfering data, scp is
suitable for quickly copying files around (similar in function to
rcp), and there is also sftp support now in OpenSSH. Using
scp/sftp is by far more secure then ftp or virtually any other
file transfer method and allows for strong user authentication.</p>
<h3>Secure FTP servers</h3>
<p>In the last few years virtually every ftp server has been hit
with a variety of problems ranging from remote root hacks to
denial of service attacks. Even OpenBSD's ftpd had a remote root
hack in it. Currently vsftpd (Very Secure FTPD) is the only ftp
server I know of specifically designed with security as it's main
goal.</p>
<h3>Interview with H D Moore</h3>
<p>H D Moore (of <a href="http://www.digitaldefense.net/">http://www.digitaldefense.net/</a>)
is the author of pasvagg.pl which exploits passive ftp and can
&quot;steal&quot; files that users are downloading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kurt: </strong>What gave you the idea for the FTP
passive attack?</p>
<p><strong>H D Moore: </strong>At the time I was doing a
comparison of different vulnerability scanners. I was going over
the CyberCop report and one of the vulnerabilities it reported
was the&nbsp; &quot;Sequential FTP Passive Port&quot;.&nbsp;
After digging around for a few minutes, I realized that nobody
had ever written an exploit for it, so the &quot;Passive
Aggression&quot; script was born. </p>
<p><strong>Kurt: </strong>Do you have any suggestions on how
server admins can avoid your passive ftp attack?</p>
<p><strong>H D Moore: </strong>The more popular Unix FTP ftp
servers already prevent this attack by default.&nbsp; A
connection to a data port by anyone other than the address
connected to the control port that requested it is dropped and
logged.&nbsp; The newer versions of ProFTPD and WU-FTPD are
immune, but any server that allows FXP transfers or
&quot;bounce&quot; scanning are vulnerable to this exploit. </p>
<p><strong>Kurt: </strong>What do you think of FTP in general? </p>
<p><strong>H D Moore: </strong>To be plain, FTP sucks.&nbsp; It
forces you to send your username and password in clear text as
well as require a separate &quot;data&quot; channel for the
actual transfer. Under &quot;active&quot; FTP, your client is
forced to open up a port to allow the server to connect
back.&nbsp; This is the other side of the &quot;Passive
Aggression&quot; exploit, sending the client a different file
than the one they requested.&nbsp; To do this you would need to
know the client's IP, but the port number is normally static
(tcp/20) for root-owned processes under linux as well as most
non-unix clients.&nbsp; By repeatedly trying to connect to a
client's ftp data port, you are almost gauranteed to be able to
replace the file they are trying to download with your own.&nbsp;
Uploads are just as fun, by finding the server data port
(passive) during an upload request, you could force the system to
accept your file instead of the client's. These types of attacks
are easy when the server allows anonymous connections or the
attacker has account on the system, because they can determine
the next passive port by repeatedly sending the &quot;PASV&quot;
command and using the next number as the target.&nbsp; Network
backups and daily mirroring jobs are one of the easiest targets,
because of the timing/race condition which is part of the attack.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt: </strong>What alternatives would you reccomend?</p>
<p><strong>H D Moore: </strong>For quick and dirty file transfers
which dont require a bit of security, netcat is your
friend.&nbsp; Using netcat you perform a network tar:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>host1 &gt; nc -l -p &lt;port&gt; | tar -zxv
host2 &gt; tar -zcv &lt;directory&gt; | nc host1 &lt;port&gt; -vv </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what the FTP protocol does, except you dont
need to send your password across the network to do it. You also
have all the features of a unix shell / pipe combination. If you
have a command-line encryption utility, you can use it send your
files encrypted across the network. Port hijacking is still an
issue and you do need shell access to each machine to do this,
but it does negate the need for an FTP server on local machines. </p>
<p>For a secure transfer protocol, I recommend scp, part of the
OpenSSH package.&nbsp; There are FREE windows clients available,
as well as Full-Featured GUI applications by companies like
F-Secure.&nbsp; SCP does incur an encryption overhead, but for
most cases it is fast enough.&nbsp; For admins that dont want to
provide shell access to thier users just to allow them to do
secure file transfers, there is a scp-only shell you can install
which provides SCP functionality but no shell access.&nbsp; The
URL escapes me, but I am sure you can find it on Freshmeat.</p>
