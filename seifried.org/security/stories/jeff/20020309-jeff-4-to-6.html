<h2>The Story of Jeff: Part IV</h2>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's in the cards for a network administrator trying to
document what is installed on the network, and to deploy a
software management system? Well, in Jeff's case nothing but bad
luck, of course.</p>
<p>Far too many network administrators concentrate on their
networks and systems. While this is hardly a firing offense,
there is a bigger picture. The week that has passed since our
last episode now comes to a close with Jeff at his workstation
composing a triumphant email.</p>

<p>As lunch rolls around, we see the main conference room

<p>After a few hours, the happily fed IT staff have wandered back
to their respective cubicles, content with their pizza and life
in general. Not far away in a quiet wiring closet, a set of
lights on an old terminal server start to blink and then, in a
soft glow, stay on for several hours before blinking out. </p>

<p>Sighing mightily, Jeff trundles out of the HR meeting with a
dated org chart of the company. As he has quickly discovered,
running an IT department involves much more then purely technical
issues.</p>
<p>Jeff pushes the paper aside. On a fresh sheet, he begins to
make a stripped-down organization chart of the company, and on
another sheet, a list of what each organization is responsible
for. Planning the deployment of a directory service is never easy
going, and Jeff knows it will rapidly deepen into a quagmire if
he doesn't first figure out the layout of the directory. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in another building at Acme Corp., Cindy, the
support lead, is puzzling over a list of telephone logs and on
another screen viewing the scripts used to parse them. She
crumples up a sheet of notepaper and kicks her chair back,
wondering what to do next.</p>

<p>As Cindy walks over to building 6 she gazes across to the
proving grounds, a scarred and ugly stretch of land pierced by
numerous small and large craters. Among other material, here rest
the remains of Acme Corp. products that didn't meet the rigid
safety specifications.</p>
<p>Knocking on Jeff's door, she considers the words she must
choose.</p>

<h2>The Story of Jeff: Part V</h2>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff hears a knock on his door and answers it. He lets Cindy
into his office, wondering what's up. </p>
<p>&quot;Have a seat.&quot; For some legroom, Cindy nudges a
piece of debris away from the area in front of her chair. </p>
<p>&quot;Jeff, I think we have a problem. . .&quot; she starts,
hoping to phrase it so he won't take it the wrong way. &quot;You
remember those phone logs I mentioned at the party?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, what about them?&quot; How nice it would be to go
home and sleep. </p>
<p>&quot;Well, it appears that someone dialed all our phone
numbers, and that someone has also been using a dial-in port on
one of our terminal servers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What terminal servers?&quot; A pall of worry flashes
across Jeff's face. &quot;No one ever mentioned this to me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have some terminal servers for dial-in access, and it
appears a Russian phone number has been using them, a lot.&quot;</p>

<td>The technique that Jeff ignored until too late is
known as wardialing. An attacker somehow gains access to
a set of company phone numbers, and then uses a
specialized tool to dial each of these numbers with a
modem. Most of the time, the wardialing utility will
reach a voice number. But occasionally, an attacker will
find a bank of modems (often used for remote employee
access), and attempt to exploit weaknesses in the host
system.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&quot;What do you mean by a lot?&quot; asks Jeff. The lack of
internal security around here seems epidemic. </p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's been in use for about six hours in the last
two days. I think we have been broken into by a Russian hacker; I
mentioned this to you several days ago at the pizza party.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hindsight is 20/20 &#151; what do you think we should do
now?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well Jeff, we could unplug the terminal server from the
network to block access.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I don't think that's such a good idea. He's probably
compromised a number of internal machines and can get in over the
Internet at this point. Arghhh!&quot; Leaning back, he rubs his
temples and wonders for a moment if taking this job was such a
great idea after all. </p>
<p>Cindy tries again. &quot;At a bare minimum, we should probably
monitor what he is doing, and maybe we could slow down his access
&#151; literally, crank the modems down to 9600 or
something.&quot; </p>
<p>Jeff considers for a moment and nods in agreement. &quot;Let's
not make him suspicious. I'll see what I can do about monitoring
his access, and then this weekend at 5 p.m. we'll shut down the
terminal server and the Internet access, and start cleaning out
the infected systems. While we're at it, I think we should
conduct a physical sweep of all offices and look for people with
modems attached to their computers.&quot; </p>
<p>Pondering this for a moment, Jeff swings his gaze down a
haphazard pile of unopened software packages, industry gimmes, on
the floor next to his desk.</p>

<td>If Jeff's predecessor had exercised more foresight,
Jeff wouldn't have to worry about hindsight. Be careful
who knows the numbers of your modem banks. If possible,
get numbers on a different exchange from those used by
the rest of the company. Require better authentication
than a simple username password system. Consider
dial-back authentication. Set firm policies for remote
access. Lastly, do as Cindy did, and pay attention to the
phone logs.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Cindy sighs. &quot;This is going to make life miserable for
the tech staff. I think we should offer performance bonuses to
make up for this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll see what I can do. . . I agree, it won't be pretty
if we make the troops do a forced march over the weekend. For
now, I'll set up a box with some demo monitoring software I got
from a vendor, and I'll order some new firewalls. I've already
had the tech team sorting some of the wiring out, and we should
be able to segment our network a bit. I've also decided we should
reset all the user account passwords &#151; with the new password
policy, users will have to choose a reasonably secure
password.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Wow, you're going to be a pretty unpopular guy come
Monday, you know.&quot; Cindy grins to herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah I know, but it's got to be done. Hopefully this
will let us get ahead of the curve.&quot; </p>
<p>Cindy gets up and stretches her neck. &quot;Well, it can't get
much worse, Jeff. At least we've got the software upgrade system
in place and protected. You know, with the way our network
servers have been put together we're probably better off just
doing fresh installations on all the file, print and application
servers, which are probably the ones with the most holes.
Luckily, I was able to get the NT PDC and BDCs set up properly
behind their own firewalls.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I was wondering who did that, Cindy. I think you
may have saved our collective bacon. Where did you get the idea
for that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My niece is into computers, and she made that suggestion
the last time there was a &quot;take your daughter to work
day.&quot; She's also the one that wrote the scripts to monitor
call activity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, how much did that cost us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing &#151; unless you count the sushi we had for
lunch after she wrote them.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well, I guess we've done what we can for now. We'll call
a staff meeting tomorrow in person, and avoid using the email
system to discuss this. What a pain.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy nods, exiting in a hurry. She grabs her coat and starts
towards her car, taking a quick detour to look in on the terminal
server. &quot;I'll get you yet,&quot; she murmurs.</p>
<p>Has Cindy been taking her medication? Will Jeff manage to
convince the tech team to work a full weekend? And why hasn't
anyone let the cat out yet? These questions and more will be
answered next week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Story of Jeff: Part VI</h2>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A brightly lit server room. Fans humming quietly, a glass wall
at one end; on the other side we see a table with several people
sitting around it. Scattered on the table are several pads of
paper, pencils, pagers and a laptop. We see Jeff, eyes a healthy
shade of bloodshot pink accented by dark bags underneath. Lifting
a cup of cold coffee to his lips, he grimaces and takes a deep
gulp, swallowing it hurriedly.</p>
<p>Cindy sits to his left, makeup long since removed, hair tied
up with a loose piece of cat 5. She rubs her eyes and yawns
softly. Andy looks at his notes with watery eyes and then glances
around the table before speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;OK folks, we found seven workstations with Back Orifice
2000 installed, and cleaned them off. We installed antivirus on
every single server and workstation, so we shouldn't have to
worry about that again. We've changed everyone's passwords to a
random 8-digit string and set it so they have to change it.
Cindy, you guys are ready for it?&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy nods her head in assent. &quot;I've got the entire
helpdesk staff on for tomorrow to answer the phone. We've also
left printed instructions taped to each monitor for how to call
the helpdesk and get the new password. Basically, they phone up,
identify themselves, we ask a personal question from info HR has
on file, we then give them their password. </p>
<p>&quot;We also have a list of all user accounts, and any
accounts that people haven't phoned about by Friday we'll disable
&#151; this should help us weed out old accounts. We'll also be
able to create a mapping of usernames to people, so when people
leave the company we can quickly remove their access.&quot;</p>

<p>Jeff looks relieved. &quot;Good work, I hadn't thought of
that. OK, so we've got software up to date, systems cleaned up .
. . but the modem pool is still exposed, for example. Anyone have
any ideas about that?&quot;</p>
<p>Andy glances around and decides to step forward. &quot;Well, I
did see a product a few months ago, I can't remember where, but
it should solve our problems. It's called TeleWall. You plug it
in before your PBX and it's a firewall for phone lines.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeff ponders this. &quot;Hmm, can we block based on the phone
number it's from, and what time it is?&quot;</p>
<p>Andy grins. &quot;You bet. You also can't get around it with
*6l to block caller ID. It can also tell what kind of phone call
it is, voice or data or fax, and we can do a lot of logging
independent of the terminal server. It handles 24 lines, so
that's perfect for our dial-in pool.&quot; </p>
<p>Yawning loudly, Jeff rubs his eyes. Then he sighs. &quot;OK.
If it's not too expensive I guess we should get one. We can then
block that little weasel completely and get his phone
number.&quot;</p>

</table>
<p>Cindy groans. &quot;Can I please go home. . . . I have no
feeling in the back of my head anymore. I think my brain feel
asleep.&quot; </p>
<p>Jeff is silent for a moment. &quot;No, I can feel mine and it
hurts. We have one last area to cover and then we can leave.
Andy, what do you think about implementing security policies on
the Windows machines? I think we should prevent users from
accessing the network control panel, which is how those seven
workstations got infected. </p>
<p>&quot;We should also look at only allowing certain programs to
run on the machines that the data entry people use. We need to
get a list of software that these people use, and we also need to
figure out which parts of their workstations users do not need
access to.&quot;</p>
<p>Andy nods his head. &quot;Agreed. The main issue will be
replicating the security policies between servers, but I think we
can do it more reliably than using Microsoft's replicate service.
We'll get some complaints from those power users, but I expect
we'll save money on the helpdesk in the long run.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Agreed, now can we please go home?&quot; Standing now,
Cindy looks around for her purse and starts to think about a hot
bath.</p>
<p>&quot;Definitely, get a good night's sleep. I'll be making a
presentation to the board, and I think we're in good shape.&quot;
Jeff stands up, knocking over a few empty coffee cups in the
process before getting oriented and heading for the door.</p>
<p>Monday dawns bright and sunny. The birds twitter and chirp
happily, blissfully unaware of the painful transition going on
inside Acme Corp.'s main building. At the helpdesk we see phones
ringing and a group of harried-looking techs.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, this is the helpdesk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You guys changed my password. I demand you change it
back!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but we can't do that. If you can give me your
name and the username you use, we can tell you what your new
password is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want a new password! I want my old one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry sir, but that's not possible. It's a new
company policy &#151; it's to prevent unauthorized access to your
account.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hrmph. Fine, my name is Joe Bloggs and my username is
joebloggs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, and what are the last four digits of your
social security number?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhmm . . . let me check . . . oh yes, 1-2-3-4.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks. Your new password is Qh3ghe5d. Once you log in,
you will be prompted to change your password, so you can set it
to whatever you like as long as it is eight letters or more and
has upper-case letters and numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's not very nice, you know, changing our passwords
without warning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry sir, but it came from the head of IT.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, all right . . . thanks.&quot; <i>Click.</i></p>
<p>In another, more peaceful part of the building, Andy hangs up
the phone and stretches. Getting up, he walks over to Jeff's
office and knocks on the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Come in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK, I ordered the TeleWall. It'll be here by tomorrow 10
a.m., so we can probably have it set up by noon. We should look
at ordering some more so we can cover all our phone lines.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, we should be able to afford that. Thank god for
the budget increase.&quot;</p>
<p>The sun sets, the birds fall asleep, and before you could
finish compiling a Linux kernel on a 386/20, the land starts to
brighten again. Several hours later, in a dusty wiring closet,
the sound of sneezing and a power screwdriver emanates. Andy
wipes his forehead, happy to have the unit plugged in and wired
up. Closing the door, he walks to his office and fires up the
control program.</p>
<p>Hunting around his desk, he pulls out a manual and starts to
read the instructions. After several hours of tinkering and
fiddling, Andy decides to call it a day. He has configured the
TeleWall to log all incoming phone numbers to the modem pool and
block any voice and fax calls, as well as any outbound calls from
the modem pool.</p>
<p>In a dark apartment somewhere in Moscow, Karl is frowning. He
looks at his printed list of passwords, frowns, and types it in
again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Username: joebloggs<br>
Password: ****<br>
Invalid entry, please try again<br>
Username:<br>
</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will Karl fall into the freshly planted Venus flytrap? Does
Jeff survive yet another board meeting? How securely is the third
tape rack on the back wall of the server room secured?</p>
