<h2>The Story of Jeff - Part X</h2>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like a spinning top, our situation is extremely stable as long
as things are moving fast enough &#151; but it will slow down,
start to wobble, and eventually crash. </p>
<p>Several technicians clad in white overalls leave a room deep
in the sub-sub-basement at Acme Corp. Separating from the group,
one of the technicians approaches Jeff.</p>
<p>&quot;The room is clean. We'll start our building sweep now.
You're sure you want us to do the entire building? It's not
cheap, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure.&quot;</p>
<p>This overtime bonus will be massive. The lead technician grins
and wanders off to find his coworkers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>As they file into the room, looking rather grim, the senior IT
staff of Acme Corp glance around. They're not quite sure they
believe that the room is not electronically bugged. Jeff closes
and locks the door, and then decides that wedging a chair under
the knob might be a good idea as well. His eyes dart around the
table and he sighs quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;Uhmm. . . let me start by saying I'm sorry, Cindy, but
it looked pretty bad. I didn't think they'd charge you with
treason, either.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy glares. Then she bounces an empty coffee mug off Jeff's
forehead. &quot;You better not fall asleep in the same time zone
as me, lest you wake up in a tub of ice, buddy!&quot;</p>
<p>Dragging himself upright with the help of a chair, Jeff
winces. &quot;OK. . . enough. Please, stop throwing things
already!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forty years of forced labor in marketing! Forty
years!&quot;</p>
<p>Staring at Cindy with fear, Andy clears his throat and decides
to get things moving. &quot;Maybe we should put that behind us
for now and deal with our current problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeff nods and winces as the blood sloshes forward in his head.
&quot;Ooogh. . . yeah. . . I think it's safe to say we've had a
major security breach. Someone with physical access to the
building&#151;&quot;</p>
<p>Andy interrupts. &quot;Or the attacker bribed someone to do
it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right. . . but the fingerprints on the devices didn't
match. So let's assume it was an outsider that's not on
file.&quot;</p>
<p>Andy taps a pencil on the table gently, in deep thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, the attacker got in pretty deep and we kicked him
out. Chances are he'll be back, so I suggest we pretend that
everyone is back to normal, but keep a close eye on
everything.&quot; </p>
<p>Jeff nods, keeping his eyes on Cindy in case she decides to
hurt him again.</p>
<p>&quot;I've had security install some more cameras, including
several in the server room, and I'll be sleeping under my desk
with the alarm rigged to wake me up if anyone goes into the
server room. Every attack has been more elaborate and risky, so I
think the server room is the logical place to strike. Stealing
one backup tape would accomplish the same thing as all the other
work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going home to spend some time with my niece,&quot;
Cindy says. &quot;I won't be coming in tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine by me,&quot; Jeff replies. With her not at work,
there is less danger of more bruises from flying coffee mugs.</p>
<p>The meeting breaks up. Andy pulls the chair out from under the
doorknob and looks at Jeff. &quot;Well, I just hope in future we
can tell each other about any problems, rather than narcing on
them to the security directorate.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeff nods, wincing again as his brain smacks the front of his
skull. He wanders off to his office, loosens his tie and curls up
under his desk. He yawns before tugging the blanket up and
closing his eyes.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Cindy folds her cell phone up and stomps down on the
accelerator. Passing an ambulance, she swerves across five lanes
of traffic to the offramp. She glances at her watch and frowns,
narrowly avoiding running over a startled squeegee kid. Tires
squealing, she leaves a long black trail terminating in front of
her sister's house. She hops out of the car and glances at her
watch again. It's better late than never.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Mindy, where's Samantha?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She left an hour ago. . . she was really angry.&quot;
Mindy turns around and sorts through some stuff on the table.
&quot;She left this for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Opening the envelope, Cindy frowns and unfolds the letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Cindy,</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I can't go on like this. Everyone hates me
and I need to do what the voices in my head told me to.
Please don't forget to feed my fish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cindy looks up. &quot;I told you to make her take her
medication! Do you know where she was going?&quot;</p>
<p>Mindy shakes her head. &quot;All she said is that someone
stole the key to her ghost. . . she wasn't making much
sense.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Across the city in Jeff's office, we hear a loud klaxon. A
startled Jeff bangs his head against the underside of his desk.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh, shut it off! Shut it off!&quot;</p>
<p>Realizing he is the only person around, Jeff crawls over to
the alarm and switches it off. He looks up at the monitor. A
short figure clad in black is trying to jimmy open the tape
cabinet.</p>
<p>Jeff blinks a few times. His brain slowly processes the
information; eventually a neuron fires (later to be identified by
science as a panic neuron). Turning quickly, he flings the door
open and goes running towards the server room.</p>

<td>If you detect an intruder, you might want to call
security before confronting anyone.</td>

</table>
<p>Jeff punches the code into the door lock, but gets it wrong
the first time. He takes a deep breath and gently taps it in. He
breathes out as the light turns green.</p>
<p>&quot;You! By the tape cabinet! Stop!&quot; Hmm. He should
have called security.</p>
<p>The intruder looks up, surprised. She stands and takes a swing
at Jeff with a crowbar. Avoiding clumsily, Jeff grabs for her,
but instead of gaining a firm grip succeeds only in pulling her
balaclava off. &quot;You! Samantha? Did Cindy make you do
this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, stupid! It was me all along!&quot; Grunting, she
takes another swing at Jeff. The bar sinks into his stomach;
gasping for air, he stumbles backwards. </p>
<p>&quot;It was going to be perfect! I'd steal all your R&amp;D
and sell it to EMCA, and then me and Cindy would move to Borneo
and live happily ever after!&quot;</p>
<p>Jeff stumbles away from her, backs into the tape storage rack
and falls down. He looks up, gasping for breath and holding up a
hand to protect himself. Samantha lunges forward looking to
finish him off, but suddenly stops.</p>
<p>Jeff finally gets his breath back. &quot;I'll kill you!&quot;</p>
<p>Samantha backs off slightly. &quot;Look out! The&#151;&quot;</p>
<p>With a loud crack, the raised floor has given out. The tape
storage rack tips forward violently, falling onto Jeff with a wet
squelching noise.</p>
<p>Samantha pales and steps forwards to see if Jeff is okay. She
begins to look decidedly ill. She turns away, wiping a tear from
her cheek, and leaves the server room.</p>
<p>Cindy enters the room several minutes later. She spies the
tape rack on its side and advances cautiously. Letting out a
movie starlet-quality shriek, she passes out on the floor.</p>
<p>Has Jeff died? Will Cindy take the rap? Does Samantha make it
to Borneo? Stay tuned, same bat channel, same bat time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Story of Jeff - Part XI</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rubbing the back of her head, Cindy sits up groggily. With a
startled expression she looks over at the tape rack and then
stands upright. She walks over to the phone and dials. </p>
<p>&quot;Hello, security? There's been an incident in the server
room. I need you to call the police and seal the building &#151;
no one goes in or out. I also want you to immediately find a
member of the board and check on the surveillance tapes to make
sure they're OK. Also, I need a security guard down here now to
guard the door.&quot;</p>

<td>Do you have a plan for sealing the building and
preventing an intruder from leaving? Are there enough
security people to guard all the fire exits, or do you
have teams of employees that can do so? Is the room with
all your surveillance recording equipment hardened and
alarmed? <p>Most people think of physical security as
simply keeping people out of a building, but you may also
need to keep them in. What's more, surveillance equipment
is only good if you have the tapes. If an attacker steals
or damages them you may have no evidence. When you must
check something critical, send at least two people so
that there is a witness.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&quot;Yes ma'am. What should I tell the police?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell them there was an incident in which an employee may
have been killed, but things are a bit confused at the
moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Glancing around she notices several missing floor tiles, and a
strong scent of ammonia. Blinking, she inspects the room, behind
equipment and into the raised floor as well as the false ceiling.</p>

</table>
<p>Cindy walks out and jogs over to the security desk.</p>
<p>&quot;Are the tapes OK? Has anyone tried to leave the building
with a big bag or box?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charlie is just checking the tape room with Mr. White,
and no, I haven't seen anyone leave through the main entrance
with a large bag or box.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy nods, feeling a bit relieved. Perhaps Jeff's death was
staged as a practical joke by the R&amp;D team. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey Dave, I'm in the surveillance room with Mr. White,
and some of the tapes are missing. Tapes for the server room,
several hallways and one of the exits have gone missing. We're
going to lock the room, and I'm staying here to make sure no more
tapes go missing.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy looks rather pale. She sits down and takes a deep
breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Dave, can you please tell Charlie to tell Mr. White to
come to the security desk? Also, I want you to call in all the
guards on the emergency call sheet and have them here
immediately.&quot;</p>
<p>Dave nods and pulls out a list. &quot;Ma'am, if you don't mind
me asking, what the heck is going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not entirely sure, but I think something serious. I
went into the server room. . . and. . . and&#151;&quot; Wiping a
tear from her eye, Cindy stifles a sob. &quot;I think I saw
Jeff's body, he was dead. . . but I passed out. . . and when I
came to. . . he was gone.&quot;</p>

<p>Dave nods and opens up a drawer. He pulls out a bottle of
brandy and pours some into a paper cup. &quot;Drink this, it'll
help calm you down.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy gulps the drink, coughing as the 80 proof &quot;Old
Stinky&quot; brandy hits her throat. &quot;This stuff is
terrible!&quot;</p>
<p>Dave grins. &quot;Why do you think I keep it at work? It's the
only stuff the cleaners won't drink!&quot;</p>
<p>A white sedan pulls up to the front. Two large men in cheap
suits enter the lobby.</p>
<p>&quot;Which of you is Ms. Plunkett?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am. . . er, Mr. . . .?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Detective Pembleton, and this is Detective Bayliss.
We're with homicide. What seems to be the problem?&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy coughs and relates her tale to them, wiping tears from
her eyes as it progresses.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you take us to the server room?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. Dave, any word on the extra guards?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, they should be arriving in the next 10 to 20
minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy leads the two detectives to the server room, unlocks the
door and points. &quot;In there, in the far corner. . . where the
floor tiles are missing. Watch your step.&quot; Looking away, she
leans against the wall and closes her eyes.</p>
<p>Detectives Pembleton and Bayliss walk into the room, careful
not to touch anything. Crouching in front of the missing floor
tiles, Pembleton stares intently at the floor. </p>
<p>&quot;Those look like blood stains on that edge, and there on
the floor.&quot;</p>
<p>Bayliss nods and glances around. &quot;So, uhhh. . . looks
like he hit his head on that big. . . tape rack and the killer
removed the body and the tiles and tried to clean up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct &#151; let's get forensics down here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll talk to the lady and get her story, if you could
get the tapes. . . and any entry log books. And interview the
guards.&quot;</p>
<p>Pembleton stands and follows Bayliss out. Stopping, he turns
to the guard. &quot;No one has entered or left the room since Ms.
Plunkett left?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No sir. And this is the only door.&quot;</p>
<p>Pembleton nods and wanders back to the security desk.</p>
<p>Bayliss turns to Cindy. &quot;So, you knew Jeff well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well. . . sort of, we worked together, but he's only
been here a few weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did he have any enemies? Has anyone been fired
recently?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. . . I mean, we had a few security incidents, but
there's no personal contact. And we haven't fired anyone
recently.&quot; Gulping nervously, Cindy thinks about Samantha's
room.</p>
<p>&quot;And, well. . . My niece, Samantha, she . . . she broke
into our network, and stole some R&amp;D plans. . . and, well. .
. I don't think she's been taking her medication.&quot;</p>
<p>Bayliss glances up from his notepad. &quot;Have you got an
address for her?&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy nods. &quot;But I already checked there, she left. . . .
The address is 12816 Baywood Lane. Her mother's name is
Mindy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK. We're going to have a forensics team go through the
room, standard procedure really.&quot; He pauses. &quot;Will the
dust we use for fingerprints be a problem?&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy is switching mental gears. &quot;Well, I suppose so. But
we can turn some stuff off and move it. I guess you have to dust
for prints, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile at the security desk, a rather frustrated Pembleton
is talking to several security guards.</p>
<p>&quot;So you mean to say that with all that equipment, and a
locked door that requires a passcard and a security code, someone
waltzed in and took all the tapes?&quot;</p>
<p>The guards shuffle self-consciously. They look sheepish. </p>
<p>&quot;We have the entry logs, but. . . the logs show Jeff
entering the room approximately an hour ago and leaving five
minutes later.&quot;</p>
<p>Pembleton blinks. &quot;Jeff is the missing person,
correct?&quot;</p>
<p>Charlie nods. &quot;But if the attacker took his passcard and
knew the code, he could have gotten in. It's not foolproof.&quot;</p>
<p>Pembleton sighs and rolls his eyes up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&quot;OK, I need all of you to stay put.&quot;</p>
<p>Is all the evidence gone? Is your building physically secure?
Will Cindy ever forgive Samantha? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Story of Jeff, Part XII</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cindy wakes up with dark rings around her eyes. Rubbing her
eyes, she rolls out of bed with a loud thump. Groaning, she picks
herself up and looks into the mirror.</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; Staring at her
reflection, she waits a few moments, as if expecting an answer.
She sighs and heads for the bathroom to begin her daily rituals.
She emerges a while later looking slightly less hung over.
Slipping on a pair of sunglasses, she gets into her car and
begins the drive to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>Samantha coughs, choking on the dry Arizona dust. Looking
around doubtfully, she heads towards the cafe. She opens the door
and glances up at the chimes, wondering where it is they produce
cactus-shaped bells. She sits at the counter, dumping her
knapsack onto the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;What'll it be, miss?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhm, a glass of water. . . and a hamburger and fries,
please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coming up.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking over her shoulder, the waitress wonders what the poor
kid is running from, or to. Knowing better, she decides not to
talk to her, and instead polishes the already gleaming
Toast-a-Tron 2000. </p>
<p>Samantha stares at her reflection in the counter and sighs.
How did she get into this mess? She's probably wanted for murder.
It's not like she was going to hurt him, just wound him a bit so
she could get away, but then that tape rack fell on him. She
blinks as a plate of food slides between her head and the
counter. &quot;Anything else, miss?&quot; Shaking her head,
Samantha starts greedily stuffing food into her face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;When do you think they'll be done, detective?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, they're finished dusting for prints. We found
about a dozen sets. We also took blood and other samples from the
room, so we're done with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you. The victim, uh. . . Jeff, do you think he was
murdered?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too early to tell. It could be an accident.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Security tells me they took all the videotapes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Unfortunately, all the important tapes, the server
room, hallways and such were taken, so it looks pretty
suspicious.&quot;</p>

</table>
<p>&quot;Well, if I find anything I'll tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks. Guess I need to find Pembleton before he makes
any more of your guards cry.&quot;</p>
<p>Cindy watches Detective Bayliss wander off. Chewing on a
fingernail, she spins and slowly walks towards Jeff's former
office. Changing her mind, she heads toward the elevators and
takes one to the sub-basement. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey, John, you around?&quot; Peering around a corner,
she squints into the darkness in search of the building
maintenance supervisor. </p>
<p>A rather startled John looks around, and seeing no one,
shouts, &quot;Yeah. . . just a minute!&quot; Grunting, he gives
the valve another half turn, looking relieved as it finally
closes. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey John, how are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm. . . good, had one heck of a mess to clean up after
the police mucked around in the server room. And then we had to
replace all those floor tiles on account of. . . .&quot; He
realizes better and closes his mouth with an audible snap.</p>
<p>&quot;I came to see you about the building logbooks. I need to
take a look at them.&quot;</p>
<p>Nodding, John shuffles off deeper into the labyrinth of pipes
and ventilation ducts. &quot;What is it you're looking for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, but when I find it I'll tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>John hands her several large tomes. &quot;Well, just make sure
you return them.&quot;</p>
<p>Waddling under the weight of several extremely thick books,
Cindy finally makes it back to her office and dumps them onto her
desk. Several hours later she is gazing at the setting sun,
wondering what exactly it is she's doing. But she returns to the
maintenance logs. Then she stops and her eyes widen over the
page, looking first at Jeff's signature on the bottom and then at
the purchase order itself, along with a hastily scribbled note:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>run 200 feet CCTV cable from server room #1 to office #264
    and drop. Overtime ok'ed.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Cindy hurries to Jeff's office, closing the door as she
enters. Looking around, she spies a thin black coaxial cable
dropped from the hung ceiling to behind Jeff's desk. She crouches
and peers under his desk. The only items to greet her are a large
dust ball and a tidy pile of coaxial cable next to the
workstation. She munches a fingernail and ponders for a moment.
Deciding that it probably won't do any harm, she turns Jeff's
computer on, hitting F8 before Windows can load. Choosing
&quot;Command prompt only,&quot; she gets dropped to a C prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>C:\&gt;dir</pre>
<pre>Volume in drive C has no label

<p>Cindy realizes her jaw is hanging open. She quickly turns the
computer off and leans back, thinking. Deciding caution is the
better part of valor, she turns the computer off and unplugs it.</p>

<p>Pulling Jeff's computer apart, Cindy takes the hard drive out
and puts it into a spare machine. She digs through her desk and
sorts through a pile of CD's, but gives up and dumps them back
into the drawer. She picks up her phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, helpdesk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is Cindy. Do we have any disk or data recovery
software?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhmm. . . I don't think so. Why do you ask?&quot;</p>
<p>Stifling a rude comment, she lets out her breath slowly.
&quot;Never mind, I've got it covered.&quot;</p>
<p>Pulling out her credit card, Cindy fires up a Web browser and
heads for a search engine. Several minutes later, she has
compared several products and opted for the professional version
of Ontrack's EasyRecovery software. Sending her credit card
number off into cyberspace to fend for itself, she downloads the
software and installs it on the spare machine. She crosses her
fingers and fires it up, choosing to recover everything possible
on Jeff's hard drive to the large hard drive in the other system.
She clicks Next and sits back.</p>
<p>What secrets will the recovery program unearth? Is Samantha
headed for Area 51, the real headquarters of EMCA Corp? Do you
have backups of your critical data?</p>
