<h2>The Story of Jeff: Part I</h2>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This story is the ongoing saga of Jeff, a tragic tale full of
hardship, heartbreak and triumph over impossible odds. Jeff is
your average network administrator, responsible for Acme, Inc.'s
Microsoft-based corporate network. We start with the basics, but
as Jeff's network is broken into again and again, we spiral
steadily into madness and insanity.</p>
<p>Jeff has recently been hired at Acme, Inc., makers of fine
anvils and the rocket roller skate. The previous network
administrator left Acme in the wake of some nasty administrative
power struggles.</p>
<p>After some initial legwork, identifying systems and network
layout, Jeff finds a sticky note in his new desk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To do list</p>
<ul>
<li>Install printer on 5th floor </li>
<li>Replace blue patch cables in 3rd floor wire closet
with mauve cables </li>
<li>Secure network </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While most of us aren't thrown quite so deep into the water to
learn if we will sink or swim, it isn't unheard of for new
administrators like Jeff to face this kind of an immediate test.</p>
<p>The first step is assessment. If Jeff doesn't know what he's
dealing with, he may end up doing more damage than good. He then
has to come up with a list of what needs to be done &#151;
everything from simple upgrades to installation of new
security-related software. </p>
<p>There are a number of commercial products to help Jeff
discover what is on his network, and many free tools as well. For
now, I will concentrate on the free ones. Jeff's first task is
probably to find out what network address blocks he
&quot;owns,&quot; i.e., 1.2.3.*, and which internal blocks he is
using, such as 10.*. He is unsure, but expects he can find this
information from his routers, switches and servers. He simply
lists open connections on servers (using netstat) and queries the
routers and switches for the IP addresses they are handling. He
can then execute ping sweeps, pinging every address within the
network blocks in use, to get a list of active IPs. In a perfect
world there would be a readily available list of active IPs, also
revealing the systems behind them. </p>
<p>Jeff might take advantage of a program called Cheops, ideally
suited for laying bare his network. Cheops is billed as a Swiss
army knife &#151; it will detect machines on a network, identify
their OSes, and even generate a map showing the network's layout.
Jeff can download Cheops for free; and it runs on most Unix
systems, though Linux is the best bet.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/cheops-ss.jpeg" width="296" height="207"><br>
<font size="2"><b>Cheops screenshot (click to enlarge)</b></font></p>
<p>Once Jeff knows what is on his network, he is aware he will
need to start updating software. It is generally safe to apply
the latest service packs on Microsoft products, but some
applications break, so Jeff makes sure to test them on a
non-critical system first. He could easily download NT service
packs, but like most people with Windows 98, he uses the often
laborious Windows Update tool. The good news is, Microsoft has a
Web page where he can download the actual files, to be saved, so
that distributing them to desktop users is much easier.</p>
<p>Being a reasonably lazy administrator &#151; the best kind;
more on this later &#151; Jeff decides that automating the above
task will be the best course of action. Among a number of
products to aid in this, SMS is Microsoft's offering. Having a
lot of desktops, Jeff finds SMS well worth the cost. But since
implementation is non-trivial, he decides to find someone trained
in use of the product.</p>
<p>If he worked for a smaller company, Jeff could kludge up a
solution. At the lowest end, he would have an internal Web page
for the company with links to the software, where users would
click on the links to the executables and install them.
Performing this via email would be a bad idea, as users might get
used to running executable content ostensibly from
administrators. Jeff could also use login scripts for automation.
However, some software updates are interactive and will not work
so well in this process.</p>
<p>After applying all the service packs to his NT servers and
workstations as well as the Win9x clients, Jeff decides it will
also be a good idea to upgrade everyone's version of Microsoft
Internet Explorer. MSIE is surely among the most used pieces of
software in today's world. Windows ships with it by default, and
it is &#151; sadly, in my opinion &#151; the best Web browser
overall. Unfortunately, it is also chock full of security holes. </p>
<p>If Jeff were an individual user upgrading MSIE, he would need
to download a small program (iesetup.exe) that figures out which
components to install and where to download them, and then does
so. Obviously Jeff doesn't want to walk users through this
process, nor does he want to download the same software
components several hundred times in the course of a day. This is
one area where Microsoft shines. The Internet Explorer
Administration Kit is free, reasonably easy to use, and very
powerful. </p>
<p>With a deep sigh, Jeff fires up his Web browser and points it
to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ieak/en/default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ieak/en/default.asp</a>,
clicks on Licensing &amp; Registration, then on New user, fills
in his data and then downloads the software. On this first run,
Jeff learns that it's better to wait for a lull in network
activity, as downloading a lot of software takes a while. </p>
<p>The process of creating a package is relatively
straightforward. Jeff selects the desired components and
configures them: default mail server, proxy server, and so on,
reducing the amount of work for users. The corporate version of
IEAK (there is also an ISP version) allows him to specify a
silent install option, which doesn't prompt the user for
information. This is probably the best way to go; if problems
arise during the install, most users will not be able to fix
them. Again Jeff needs somehow to get the executable to users and
have them run it. He determines to go with a login script,
followed by an email instructing users to go to an internal Web
page and run the executable. </p>
<p>Now that Jeff has solved the basic security problems that
afflict most networks, meaning outdated software, it is time to
look at another major area of network security. By default in
Windows, a username and password are given for login and access
to network resources. This works quite well but contains a
serious flaw: Users can choose poor passwords, and the default
does not stop them. So Jeff logs into his network as an
administrator, fires up User manager for domains, and then
selects Policies and then Account. If he were to force users to
change passwords often, this would annoy them and they would more
likely choose bad passwords, or else forget their good ones.</p>
<p>For most environments it is more important to specify a
minimum password length &#151; eight characters is a good start
&#151; as well as a password uniqueness. Users determined to keep
their passwords can just change them, for example to foo, foo1,
foo2 and so on, until they have changed enough times to allow
reuse of the original password.</p>
<p>Jeff knows his users will probably still use bad passwords
(like &quot;acmecorp&quot;), so enabling account lockouts is the
next best thing. The big question now becomes whether to lockout
the account until an administrator resets it, the more secure
option; or to let the account unlock after a certain time period,
which is far less hassle. Jeff, not overly concerned about people
trying to brute-force passwords or otherwise break in, lets the
accounts unlock after a short while. He will encounter far fewer
users requiring an administrator to unlock their accounts. </p>
<p>Having accomplished all this, Jeff decides to call it a day.
Unbeknownst to him, Carl the cracker &#151; or hacker, in popular
mediaspeak &#151; has just woken up and decided to break into
Acme's network because he skinned his knee using the patented
rocket roller skates. Finding the IP for Acme, Inc.'s Web server,
he telnets to port 80 on it and issues &quot;HEAD /
HTTP/1.0&quot; followed by two returns, which results in the
following output:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Server: Microsoft-IIS/4.0
Date: Sat, 25 Nov 2000 23:14:33 GMT
Content-Type: text/html

Connection closed by foreign host.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Opting for a direct approach, Carl then uses CIS to scan the
Web server. Unless Windows is secured, the default configuration
will allow him to connect and get lists of usernames, including
whether they have passwords or not, the shares available, and so
forth. It's too bad the last administrator at Acme didn't set a
required password length, because Carl finds several accounts
that contain no passwords. He points his Windows box at the Web
server using the Run command and &quot;\\1.2.3.4&quot; and is
presented with a list of shares, one of them labeled
&quot;wwwroot.&quot; Going for the throat, he edits the
index.html file to read &quot;Owned by the psychedelic cow
hugger.&quot; Then he deletes all the other files and directories
in wwwroot. </p>
<p>Waking up to a ringing phone at 3 a.m. is never fun. Jeff
groggily slaps his alarm clock for a bit until he realizes that
the phone is the root of the problem, so he answers it. On the
other end is Bob in Sales. Bob is on the road and wants to show a
customer some of the fine products Acme offers, but the Website
appears to have been deleted and all that remains is that single
frontpage with the one-line message. He doesn't know what is
wrong with it, but he does know that if it doesn't get fixed, he
will lose the sale.</p>
<p>Sighing mightily, Jeff gets dressed and drives down to the
office. (At least there is no traffic.) Logging in at his
workstation, he fires up a Web browser and looks at the Website.
After a momentary flash of panic, he settles down and tries to
think of what to do. The first priority is restoring the site
from backup so that Bob can show it to a client. But what is to
prevent the attacker from getting back in? More to the point, how
<i>did</i> he get in? </p>
<p>Having found a backup tape and put the site back up, Jeff sits
back and ponders how to keep the attacker out. Looking at the
event log, he finds nothing very useful, no record of user logins
or file accesses. Sighing gently, he goes to User manager for
domains, clicks Policies and Audit, enabling auditing on login
success and failures. He decides to enable file access logging as
well, since he can selectively enable it on directories and
files. He logs into the Web server and enables auditing of file
access on the wwwroot folder.</p>
<p>Deciding that nothing more can be done, Jeff heads back home
for a few hours of sleep. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carl heads over to IRC in search of someone to
prove his hacking prowess to. He finds several of his friends and
directs them to the URL for Acme's Website. They see the restored
Website with no apparent damage and they mock him, deeply hurting
his feelings. So he repeats the process to get in, and deletes
every file in wwwroot, as well as several other shares. He also
leaves another message. </p>
<p>Waking up to a ringing phone at 6 a.m. is especially bad when
it follows being woken up by a ringing phone at 3 a.m. After
listening to Bob's spiel a second time &#151; and Bob is
extremely agitated at this point &#151; Jeff heads back in to
work. Oozing into his workstation and popping the tab on a can of
Jolt (the first of many), he again views the event log. This time
there is some useful information. Grinning, Jeff copies the body
of an event log message into his email client and drafts a
message to Bob.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Bob - found out what happened, someone has broken
into our webserver and deleted all the files. They were using
an account that does not have a password on it, yours! Here
is the evidence from the log file:</code></p>
<pre>Object Open:
 	Object Server:	Security
 	Object Type:	File
 	Object Name:	C:\InetPub\wwwroot\default.asp

 	Accesses		DELETE 
		
 	Privileges		- </pre>
<p><code>Please change your password imediately. I will be
restoring the site from backup and have temporarily removed
your account from the www group.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sighing happily, Jeff again restores the site backup from tape
and considers returning home for some sleep. But his reverie is
rudely interrupted by Alice, a VP in accounting, who advises him
to be ready in one hour to explain to the board what is going on
with the Web server.</p>
<p>Will Jeff survive the board meeting? Will Carl find another
account with no password? Will Jeff's wife start unplugging the
phone at bedtime? Will Bob be forced to grovel to make the sale?</p>
<p>Join us for the next installment, wherein Jeff does battle
with an improperly maintained corporate network.</p>

<h2>The Story of Jeff: Part II</h2>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week Jeff did battle with passwords, and the lack of a
password policy at the company. (The November edition of <i>MCP</i>
magazine has a good article on password policy. &quot;Change in
Time,&quot; page 55, covers changing passwords.)</p>
<p>We last left Jeff at the board meeting, where he must cover
his heinie or else start looking for a new job &#151; with no
recommendation.</p>
<p><i>Cut to the boardroom. Big shiny table, kitschy artwork,

<td valign="top">Well, this morning at 3 a.m. I received
a call from Bob, who is currently in Europe. He was
trying to access our Website to show a customer a
product, but he found that our Website had been defaced.<p>What
this means is that someone broke into our Web server,
deleted all the Website-related data and placed a message
boasting of their successful attack on us. My first
priority was getting the site back online so that Bob
could provide the customer with the needed data. I did
this by restoring the site from backup tapes. I then
attempted to find the method by which the attacker broke
in, but was unable to, given the current network setup. I
enabled logging on certain events, user account logins,
and any type of access to the Website files. If the
attack happened again, I would probably have some
evidence that could be used to figure out what happened.</p>
<p>I then went back home to get some sleep, as I was in
no shape to start modifying our network configuration. At
6 a.m. Bob phoned again to say the Website was again
defaced. The good news is that the logging enabled me to
figure out what happened. The attacker found an account
on the server that had no password. They then used it to
access our server and modify the files.</p>
<p>The account that was used was Bob's. I locked his
account out so that the attacker could not use it again,
and I told Bob. I also restored the site from tape
backups again.</p>

to write up a password policy and notify users that they
all need to change their passwords. This should solve the
immediate problem of an attacker logging into our Web

passwords. I also need to secure the Web server to
prevent attackers from being able to connect to it in

<td valign="top">OK folks. As you all know, our Web
server got hacked twice. This was partially due to a user
having no password on their account. Other factors &#151;
well, lack of a properly configured firewall, improper
server configuration, out-of-date user and group
configuration. So, we've plugged some of the immediate
holes. Now it's time to look at long-term solutions. I've
been reviewing the IT department, and I'm not quite clear
on some points. First of all, who is in charge of
software updates?</td>

<td valign="top"><b>Andy:</b></td>
<td valign="top">Well, the server admins are, for the
servers, but the desktops are under the support group. .
. and they have to do updates manually, same as the
server admin group.</td>

<td valign="top">Yes, makes sense. We're going to have to
bite that bullet sooner or later.</td>

<td valign="top">I've been looking at wireless
networking, internally here for boardrooms; also possibly
at some plants, to reduce wiring costs.</td>

<td valign="top">All right. Good way to save on basic
expenses. OK, who's next?</td>

<td valign="top"><b>Cindy:</b></td>
<td valign="top">PKI and fingerprint scanners. I've been
considering ways to improve our authentication systems

Right.</td>

which is pretty old, I was thinking we might just replace
it all.</td>

<p>Jeff paces back to his office. What is the meaning of it all?
Seated in his now-familiar chair, he begins to prioritize the
problems facing Acme, and the solutions those problems will
require.</p>

<p>The list sits on Jeff's desk, defying him. He looks out the
window. Wistful, he gazes at the grass, wondering if he could
re-carpet his office with it. He reckons this will have to wait
until a long weekend. Returning to the list, he sorts through
which problems carry the highest priority, and which promise the
quickest solutions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they don't appear to match up, no matter how
creative Jeff's solutions are. Ultimately he decides that
software updates are the biggest problem. He types up a quick
memo:</p>

Subject: Software updates</code></p>
<p><code>I have decided that software updates are our largest
imediate problem. Also by solving this issue we will make
life a lot easier in the long run when it comes to deploying
new software packages. The solution to this problem is in
several parts:</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>- We need to identify the hardware and software
we curently have deployed<br>
- We need to identify who is in charge of it and what it
is for<br>
- We need to identify software products that will allow
us to update the software<br>
- We need to restructure the support group and server
admin group, I feel that the support group should be
doing support, not manual software updates (I think
they'll agree).<br>
- We need to identify which version and patch level we
will use for our major software packages (such as
Windows, Office, etc.)<br>
- We should setup a test lab so that we can test software
updates<br>
- We should standardize software packages and versions as
much as possible</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>So to start the ball rolling, anyone who knows what
is installed and what versions of software are running as
well as who &quot;owns&quot; it, is requested to document
this and submit it to me. If could put it in the form:</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>- primary IP adress<br>
- primary hostname<br>
- OS<br>
- Version<br>
- who is in charge<br>
- what is it for<br>
- major software packages installed on it<br>
- secondary IP adresses<br>
- secondary hostnames</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>If possible, plese send this in an Excel
spreadsheet. That would be apreciated.</code></p>
<p><code>-Jeff</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeff hits Send and purses his lips contentedly. Then he fires
up his Web browser and turns to the next task at hand. The search
for software to help automate software updates is never pleasant,
especially in a Windows environment. On some subconscious level,
Jeff is weighing the odds that he will end up running SMS from
Microsoft.</p>
<p>He knows SMS is pretty much the only game in town. He picks up
the phone and calls a local consulting company with whom he has
done good business in the past.</p>

<td>Hiring a consultant can be a lot like getting
married. Down the line, everything may go smoothly and
everyone be happy; or things may end horribly with
lawsuits and hurt feelings. More than a consultant's
skills are important; also consider their work ethic,
experience, and so on.</td>
