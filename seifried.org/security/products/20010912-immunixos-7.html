<p>There are basically two established Linux distributions with a
serious bent on security, ImmunixOS and NSA's SELinux. They both
have released working, mature code that you can get ahold of and
use. There are possibly other projects, but to the best of my
knowledge none are shipping code right now. </p>
<p>The NSA's SELinux is extremely powerful as far as configuring
security to a very granular level goes. However, for most people
and applications, this level of security is overkill (and there
are some significant performance hits as well). </p>
<p>ImmunixOS is aimed at making Linux more robust and improving
its survivability in the face of new security flaws. ImmunixOS
also has a much gentler learning curve than the NSA's SELinux,
and addresses issues that NSA SELinux does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SubDomain</h2>
<p>SubDomain is a kernel module that mediates system calls such
as open, and blocks access to other's that are classified as
&quot;dangerous&quot; (mknod, etc.). The other part is a small
program that administers it, loading and removing configurations.
SubDomain allows you to configure which files a process is
allowed to access, how it is allowed to access them (read / write
/ execute), and allows you to manipulate what child processes are
allowed to do.</p>
<p>Currently there are a couple of methods to achieve the task
that is vastly simplified with SubDomain.</p>
<p>If you run the program &quot;Bind&quot; (a DNS server) as a
non-root user, and only give it write access to the directories
it needs, it would still be able to write to the /tmp directory,
and read the /etc/passwd file, which has to be world readable.
The alternative would be to use ACL's and something akin to NT's
&quot;no access&quot; permission, which, when applied to every
single file that Bind did not require, would allow you to tightly
control access. This, however, would be very difficult to
maintain and configure and chances are that you would forget
something, or later add something and forget to exclude it.</p>
<p>With SubDomain you simply give named access to the files it
needs, and that is all it can access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to use SubDomain</h3>
<p>Load the kernel module (subdomain.o) and then create a
SubDomain configuration file, for example the following file is
for XNTPD, which must run as root since it adjusts the system
clock, and uses UDP for data transfer making it easy to blind
spoof the server. The following configuration allows XNTPD to
read the configuration files and libraries it requires, all it is
allowed to write to is the drift file (used at boot time to reset
the clock), &quot;/dev/null&quot;, &quot;/dev/log&quot; (for
logging) and to &quot;/tmp&quot;, for temporary files. Even if
someone exploited this program and gained full access they would
not be able to spawn off a root shell or run any useful commands
for example, all an attacker could do is toast the drift file and
potentially fill up any partition the /etc directory is on, flood
the log file, or attempt to exploit another program that uses
/tmp, however this makes life for the attacker significantly
harder than just being able to spawn off a bash shell. </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>  # XNTPD xntp3-5.93-13

  /usr/sbin/xntpd 
  {
    /etc/ntp/drift rw
    /etc/ntp/keys r
    /etc/ntp.conf r
    /etc/nsswitch.conf r
    /etc/ld.so.cache r
    /etc/protocols r
    /etc/resolv.conf r
    /etc/host.conf r
    /etc/hosts r
    /etc/localtime r
    /lib/ld-2.1.2.so r
    /lib/libc-2.1.2.so r
    /lib/libdl-2.1.2.so r
    /lib/libnss_nis-2.1.2.so r
    /lib/libnss_files-2.1.2.so r
    /lib/libnss_nisplus-2.1.2.so r
    /lib/libnsl-2.1.2.so r
    /lib/libnss_dns-2.1.2.so r
    /lib/libresolv-2.1.2.so r
    /dev/null rw
    /dev/log w
    /tmp* rw
  }
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>An attacker could potentially write something to /tmp and then
exploit another program that suffers a problem exploitable
through /tmp, however they would not be able to simply run the
program from the access they had gained through Bind. This
software significantly complicates life for attackers as they
must exploit multiple holes, and if all your network programs are
SubDomain'ed properly then a remote attacker will have a very
difficult time spawning off a shell and getting real access.
Additionally, depending on how much logging you have turned on,
you will see a huge number of error messages in syslog as the
application attempts to access files it is not allowed to (hint:
XNTPD shouldn't try to run /bin/bash). This type of thing is
easily automated. </p>
<p>You can also specify what subprocesses are allowed to do. For
example, you may have a cgi program that takes in data through a
web interface and then spawns off another program which actually
sanitizes and uses the data. This way your web cgi does not need
any real access, it simply handles some data, which is then
passed to a trusted program (that you have hopefully audited),
and through SubDomain granted access to /etc/password for
example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A Perfect Example</h3>
<p>Recently on BugTraq there was an advisory for some software,
specifically a CGI program built in Perl that reported back to
the company that sold it, and had a back door put in
intentionally by the author, supposedly allowing him to shut down
your cgi if you pirated it, or format your hard drive. Access to
this backdoor was granted through a secret string of text given
to the cgi program. Needless to say this string was found quite
quickly, allowing people to exploit sites using the cgi program.
If you had been running this cgi program with a good SubDomain
configuration, damage would have been minimized should someone
have used it to try to attack your site. They would not have been
able to execute any programs of note, nor read or write files
like /etc/passwd. Again, processing your log files regularly and
looking for SubDomain violations will provide you with early
warning, and a good idea of what is wrong (i.e. are they only
trying to read files, or run commands as well).</p>
<h3>Q and A on SubDomain</h3>
<p>Crispin Cowan is the chief architect of SubDomain, and CTO at
WireX Communications.</p>
<p><b>Kurt:</b> What is the target market for SubDomain?</p>
<p><b>Crispin:</b> SubDomain is a major plank in the Immunix
security-hardened Linux system. So broadly speaking, if you are
interested in the security of your Internet servers, SubDomain
and Immunix help you &quot;immunize&quot; them. More
specifically, SubDomain is especially effective at protecting a
host system from exploitable bugs in vulnerable software that may
have been installed on a server, making SubDomain particularly
attractive for defending Internet servers. This is especially
true for Internet web servers, where the major threat is buggy
CGI/Perl code. SubDomain confinement of these flakey CGI scripts
protects the rest of the web server from attempts to exploit bugs
in the CGI code. </p>
<p><b>Kurt:</b> When will SubDomain be available?</p>
<p><b>Crispin:</b> We hope to have an Immunix SDK out by June 1.
The Immunix SDK would include tools for writing SubDomain
profiles. </p>
<p><b>Kurt:</b> What will the license for SubDomain be? Will
private individuals/companies be able to use it on their servers?</p>
<p><b>Crispin:</b> We're going to roll our own license. While we
have not yet thought up a catchy name for it :-) here's a list of
what you can do with SubDomain for free: </p>
<ul>
<li>Download it. </li>
<li>Use it on your server, even if it is a commercial server.
<ul>
<li>If it is a commercial server (e.g. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.Microsoft.com/</a>)
then we require you to display a &quot;Powered by
Immunix&quot; logo somewhere on the site's home
page. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Develop profiles for it for use on your server. </li>
<li>Distribute SubDomain profiles along with your software. </li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, we will have certain licensing fees for
these kinds of things: </p>
<ul>
<li>Full source code access </li>
<li>Reselling it for money </li>
<li>Including SubDomain in a product for sale <ul>
<li>If you would like to include SubDomain in a
commercial product, contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80f3e1ece5f3c0f7e9f2e5f8aee3efed"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d3a0b2bfb6a093a4baa1b6abfdb0bcbe">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></a>
for licensing information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commercial hosting services <ul>
<li>If it's a value-add that you offer Immunized
servers to your customers, we will charge a
licensing fee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Kurt:</b> What do you see as the main benefit of SubDomain?</p>
<p><b>Crispin:</b> The main benefit of SubDomain is the ability
to run potentially vulnerable software on your server in relative
safety. You can think of it as a flexible chroot on steroids.
Like chroot, a SubDomain'ed program is prevented from accessing
unintended parts of your server, e.g. the Web server and its CGIs
can't access the mail server's files. Unlike chroot, a SubDomain
profile can grant controlled access to other parts of the system
that you want to. If you want to chroot two programs, you have to
decide whether they are in the same jail where they are at each
other's mercy, or separate jails where they cannot communicate at
all. With SubDomain, you can put them in separate jails, but
still provide them with a controlled interface. </p>
<p><b>Kurt:</b> What do you see as the main drawback of
SubDomain?</p>
<p><b>Crispin:</b> The biggest drawback is that, unlike
StackGuard, SubDomain protection is not totally automatic.
Someone who understands the program has to create the profile
that describes the files it can access. The tools in the Immunix
SDK will help you do that, but you still have to run the program
through a sufficient test suite to touch all the files that it
will need to touch. </p>
<p>Addressing this problem is part of why we're giving out
freebie copies of SubDomain to individuals. Our hope is that some
people will find it useful, and will write SubDomain profiles for
their server programs. These profiles can be included in an RPM
so that they land in /etc/subdomain.conf. This is harmless on
non-SubDomain kernels, and safely confines the program on
SubDomain kernels.</p>
<h3>SubDomain summary</h3>
<p>Between Crispin Cowan's past work on StackGuard and the simple
fact I used SubDomain for about a month in testing and now for
almost a month in production (on a 2.2.14 kernel, Red Hat
system), I am pretty much convinced as to it's effectiveness. The
part I really love is it's brute simplicity. You patch and
recompile your kernel (something almost all administrators do for
other reasons anyway), reboot, download/create some SubDomain
profiles, and load them. That's it, no mucking about with your
software, system setup or other things. If you want to update
software that is SubDomain'ed, simply do so. Most times your
SubDomain profile won't even require any changes. It's also great
because it can be used to control software that runs as root,
something chroot does not accomplish effectively. About the only
thing I don't like is that SubDomain is not OpenSource. However,
the source code can be licensed, and Crispin does have a pretty
solid track record security wise. The subdomain.o kernel module
is only a few thousand lines of code, and under 24k compiled,
simplicity and ease of auditing is a major bonus (to contrast,
SGI's security patches for Linux are about 3MB's of source code
and growing, while they do a lot of things, they are a lot more
complex and difficult to configure). SubDomain addresses a large
number of widespread problems in a very simple and effective
fashion, I like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>StackGuard</h2>
<p>This is one of the more widely used components of ImmunixOS,
having been around for several years and being freely available.
StackGuard is a set of compiler patches. When you compile
software using a StackGuard-enabled GCC, it will help prevent
some types of stack smashing attacks (a.k.a. buffer overflows).
To quote the StackGuard page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>StackGuard detects and defeats stack smashing attacks by
protecting the return address on the stack from being
altered.&nbsp; StackGuard places a &quot;canary&quot; word
next to the return address when a function is called.&nbsp;
If the canary word has been altered when the function
returns, then a stack smashing attack has been attempted, and
the program responds by emitting an intruder alert into
syslog, and then halts. </p>
<p>For it to be effective, the attacker must not be able to
&quot;spoof&quot; the canary word by embedding the value for
the canary word in the attack string.&nbsp; StackGuard offers
a range of techniques to prevent canary spoofing: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Random canaries</b>:&nbsp; the canary word value
is chosen at random at the time the program
execs.&nbsp; Thus the attacker cannot learn the
canary value prior to the program start by searching
the executable image.&nbsp; The random value is taken
from <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> if available, and created
by hashing the time of day if <tt>/dev/urandom</tt>
is not supported. </li>
<li><b>Null canary</b>: the canary word is
&quot;null&quot;, i.e. <tt>0x00000000</tt>. Since
most string operations that are exploited by stack
smashing attacks terminate on null, the attacker
cannot easily spoof a series of nulls into the middle
of the string.&nbsp; This mechanism was originally
proposed by &quot;der Mouse&quot; in Bugtraq. </li>
<li><b>Terminator canary</b>: not all string operations
are terminated by null, e.g. <tt>gets()</tt>
terminates on new line or end-of-file (represented as
-1).&nbsp; The terminator canary is a combination of
Null, CR, LF, and -1 (<tt>0xFF</tt>) which should
terminate most string operations. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While it won't stop all of them, StackGuard does make life
significantly more difficult for an attacker. This software is
available by default, and the majority of ImmunixOS software is
compiled using this, resulting in fewer successful attacks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>FormatGuard</h2>
<p>FormatGuard is a relatively new entry to ImmunixOS, but like
StackGuard most users will not realize its existence, and many
administrators will probably not notice either. </p>
<p>FormatGuard addresses a relatively recent (well known for less
than a year) problem in a number of common system calls.
Basically, if you took user input without properly validating or
filtering it (always a bad idea), it was possible for an attacker
to insert malicious characters that could be used to elevate
privileges in more than a few programs (WU-FTPD for example). </p>
<p>As fixing every call to printf(), syslog() and so on is nearly
impossible, the WireX folks decided to fix the system calls
themselves (or at least make them appreciably safer). Thus was
FormatGuard born, It's basically a wrapper around these unsafe
calls, so that you can use software that probably hasn't been
properly audited and not worry as much. Like StackGuard, it makes
life quite a bit harder for attackers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>RaceGuard/CryptoMark</h2>
<p>Last but not least, we have RaceGuard and CryptoMark. As far
as I know, neither has been released yet. However, RaceGuard is
planned for the next release of ImmunixOS. Crispin Cowan (CTO at
WireX) had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a kernel enhancement that makes mktemp (and
hand-rolled variations) safe to use.&nbsp; In the StackGuard
tradition, it detects attempts to race the victim suid root
program in progress, and (optionally) either refuses the
killer open() call, or kills the victim process.&nbsp; I've
been running it on my laptop for a month, and there's a few
teething problems, but it basically works.&nbsp; It will be
in Immunix 7.1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CryptoMark is a sort of tripwire-style program, except that it
operates in real time (remarkably similar to SecureExe in
description). If it is released and works as advertised, it will
not only prevent Trojans from running, but will help prevent
users from running unauthorized programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It's a pity that only WireX and the NSA have decided to put
real effort into making more secure Linux kernels and
distributions. With the vast majority of vendors taking a very
reactive security stance, most users are left out in the cold
between the time a problem is found and when a vendor ships a
fix.</p>
<p>With programs like ImmunixOS, you actually have a chance of
surviving the attack. If it's a buffer overflow StackGuard might
stop it; or the attacker will not be able to do as much damage if
SubDomain is properly set up. </p>
<p>I doubt large vendors will make the effort, because when it
comes right down to it, the majority of computer users will
complain about security, but spend money on products with more
features even if they are less secure.</p>
