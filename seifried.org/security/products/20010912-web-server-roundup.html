<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>There are a variety of secure webservers, but which one is
right for you? In this article I will start the process of
helping you to choose the right server for your environment. In
this series of closet articles I will cover legality,
availability, features, and so on of the major secure server
packages, using Linux primarily for my testing. The choice of
operating system is important, but the choice of www server is
usually more important, since that will define your feature set,
and long term potential. In conjunction with these articles will
be a series of individual product reviews of the more popular
servers. This review will only cover 128 bit platforms as I feel
128 bit encryption is relatively weak, and 40 and 56 bit
encryption is worthless, please keep this in mind as it will
affect availability quite a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Export/Import, Platform availability and Licensing issues</h3>
<p>This is the first hurdle, if the webserver available in your
country, and for your platform of choice? Servers made in the USA
for example are generally not much use outside the USA since the
export of strong crypto is heavily restricted (to Canada only).
Free servers that have not paid for RSA data licenses are
generally not used in the USA since RSA is patented there, and
you must pay for the use of RSA data components. This first table
is a list of server products, their origin and the countries you
may or may not use them in:</p>

<p>Platform availability is your next concern, if you are
experienced with Solaris and have no experience with Linux you'd
probably be best off with a server that runs on Solaris. When
handling secure web serving the server platform MUST be secure
otherwise it isn't worth bothering in the first place. In the
following chart I have attempted to be as precise as possible,
yes is more likes a &quot;probably&quot;, no is &quot;definitely
not&quot;, blank means I don't know.</p>

<p>*Apache and OpenSSL support most platforms.</p>
<p>**Linux glibc is Red Hat 5.x and beyond, Slackware 7.0, or
basically any modern distribution (I can't think of any current
Linux distributions that are not glibc based).</p>
<p>± These software packages are OpenSource, so if your platform
is not supported you can port it yourself or pay someone to,
chances are an effort is underway</p>
<p>As you can see the most prolific platforms are Linux and
Solaris, both of which service their respective markets ver well.
Apache has a variety of SSL options, either relying on
&quot;free&quot; SSL implementations, like OpenSSL, or commercial
ones, like Raven. Apache currently has 50%+ of the non secure
server market, so if you are looking for a familiar face Apache
with an SSL module, or an Apache derived server (Like Red Hat's,
or Stronghold's) are a good bet. </p>
<p>Another major factor in choosing your webserver will be the
license, cost and support options available. For many people it
is preferable to simply get a quick answer from a support
organization rather then spend time trying to figure it out
themselves, just as some people will be opposed to anything that
is not open source. Luckily the RSA patent has expired in the USA
and you can now legally use OpenSource software with OpenSSL
without having to disable RSA, use RSAREF (a broken
implementation) or paying RSA for a license.</p>

<h3>Other variables</h3>
<p>The various secure web servers can be broadly broken into two
categories, those based on Apache, and those that are not. The
Apache based servers tend to be somewhat barebones, with no fancy
web based GUI's for setup and management of servers, which some
people dislike in any case. On advantage is the sheer number of
non secure Apache www sites have resulted in a large number of
people that are very proficient with Apache, so finding online
support is less difficult then one would think, however if it is
a secure server issue as opposed to a generic Apache issue,
finding support will be somewhat more difficult. Another decision
is to use an OpenSource server (such as Apache or Roxen) or a
closed source, there are arguments both ways, but ultimately it
will be more of a political issue then anything else in most
cases. Another issue is the use of hardware cryptographic
accelerators. These range from a plug in PCI card to a full blown
network appliance you plug in between the www server and the
internet. Depending on the cryptographic accelerator you buy you
may not even need a secure www server (this generally is only for
the high end network appliances). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>There is no overall &quot;best&quot; www server even just
taking availability issues into account. Various servers are
appropriate for various situations. In the following articles and
product reviews I will attempt to cover the major areas of www
server considerations such as configuration, features, security,
flexibility, scalability, and so on. Next week I'll be covering
smart cards (which tie in nicely to secure web serving), the week
after that we'll start comparing features of the various www
server products.</p>
<p>Comparision </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month I started the web server round up, and
unfortunately it looks like I bit off a lot more then I can chew.
Properly testing each web server takes a lot of time (10-30
hours), and that doesn't include any time to actually write about
the results. Well I've finally worked my way through most of the
servers, and it's been interesting. A web server isn't any good
if you can't get it installed properly, configured properly, or
if it simply does not posses the feature set you require. The
majority of these products do allow you to download demonstration
versions (or are completely free in some cases), I would advise
trying them out first to make sure you end up with the one you
want (in other words don't believe everything you read, including
this =). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ease of installation</h3>
<p>This is an obvious choice for the first thing to cover, if you
can't get the server installed properly it's probably not going
to do you much good. In some cases the installation required
compiling of software components, but the majority of the
commercial products that are OpenSource (and partially or
completely available as source code) came in binary format,
easing installation. Where possible I used binary installations,
as this is what the majority of users will opt to do (I have
nothing against compiling personally, but most people will take
the path of least resistance, myself included). For the
&quot;free&quot; SSL based server that use OpenSSL you also have
to compile or find a binary of OpenSSL, so I included that in the
process where it was required. In all cases I would recommend
getting the most recent version, they will contain any needed bug
fixes, and any installation/compiling problems that exist in
older ones have probably been fixed. All my installations were
done on a stock Red Hat 6.1 box, and in no case did I hit any
significant difficulties, in most cases the installs took less
then 5 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The next big item on the road to &quot;getting it to
work&quot;. All but one of the Apache based servers don't have
any significant improvements (i.e. any tools for configuration),
which shouldn't be a problem for most administrators, but for
maintaining many sites automated tools and templates are useful.
In addition to this is the degree of detail allowed, can you
easily set one virtual site to have access to Java servlets, and
no others sites for example? If you plan to host more then one
site chances are you will find yourself wanting a high degree of
control over who gets access to what, especially if you charge
people for features (think virtual web hosting). </p>

<h3>Features (a.k.a. bells and whistles).</h3>
<p>This is one area where most people exhibit interest, in all
honesty most of these web servers do a pretty fair job of serving
data, they are all pretty stable (almost all the above products
are used at a variety of large sites). All the servers provide a
certain baseline of functionality, they can server static
documents, a variety of dynamic documents (such as server side
includes), they have a CGI interface (so you can tie programs
into your site), and so on. One major feature more and more sites
(especially sites doing virtual hosting) are using is FrontPage
extensions, which are full of security holes under UNIX and not
really recommended (the vendor that wrote the FrontPage
extensions for UNIX has a less then stellar track record security
wise). One way around this is to use Samba to share out the www
files selectively to clients (the username and password can be
encrypted, the data is not, so it isn't any worse from a security
point of view then FrontPage extensions are), however it does not
allow them to make use of some of FrontPages more advanced
features. I actually started an HTML table with a listing of all
the important features, but in almost all cases all the servers
supported the features listed, so it struck me as rather
pointless. The Zeus, Roxen and Netscape Enterprise web servers do
have some additional features not currently available in Apache,
Roxen for example has RXML, a server side scripting language that
allows for dynamic content (similar to PHP). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Support / Documentation</h3>
<p>As with any products chances are at some point you will need
assistance with it. When that time comes you will need to find
help, if you're lucky it will be covered in the documentation.
The Apache based products of course are the best documented,
there are many books available, and the apache web site which has
pretty much full documentation on the server itself (although
some of the SSL directives are not covered or are different). All
the vendors support their own products, and several will probably
support Apache-SSL, and Apache mod-ssl if you pay them (since in
some cases the commercial products makes use of the same OpenSSL
that the two free ones do). There is a definite advantage to
choose an Apache based product, with over 50% of the non-secure
market, finding a competent Apache administrator or support
organization is not to difficult.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For the cost conscious, especially if only running one or two
sites, an Apache based solution is ideal. For high volume web
serving, or serving many sites with similar configurations Apache
also works very well, but you will need to apply a lot of elbow
grease in administration and maintenance (basically you will
probably want to write scripts and other automation tools to
assist you). The Apache based servers are in some ways the
simplest to configure (one nicely commented text file), and the
easiest to find support for online (there are many books devoted
to Apache) as well as being very cheap (ranging from free to $160
USD, $357 USD and up). If you want something with a few more
bells and whistles, and a nice www interface Roxen is the next
logical step, Roxen is OpenSource and free (for the basic
server), however you cannot yet use it legally in the US (due to
the RSA patent). If you're willing to spend the money then Roxen
probably wins for sheer number of features and add-ons (but
$11,800 USD might be seen as a bit pricey for many people). If
you don't mind spending money, and want to get an extremely high
performance server then Zeus is the ticket (every single web
record I have seen uses Zeus). Zeus has the best configuration
interface I have seen, allowing you to manage multiple servers,
multiple sites, and it scales well. Netscape seems like a very
popular secure web server for major sites, it has great java
servlet support, and a wonderful www interface, making it very
simple to setup and maintain. They are all very good server
products, if used in the right environment and administered
properly (unfortunately there is no way around that yet).
Fortunately with almost all the products you can get evaluation
versions, so try before you commit to a web server, and make sure
it supports features you think you might need in the future
(because chances are you will need them).</p>
