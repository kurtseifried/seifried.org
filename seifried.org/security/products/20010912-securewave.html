<p>Like many people, I use Microsoft products on a regular basis,
but having spent as much or more (probably more) time in Unix, I
find certain things frustrating. In the Unix world, I take for
granted the ability to set permissions on files and devices.
While NT and 2000 have file permissions, you cannot easily
restrict users' access to communications ports and removable
media, for example. </p>
<p>I also want to be able to restrict what users can and cannot
run. There are a number of ways to do this in Unix, with varying
degrees of difficulty to implement and of effectiveness. </p>
<p>Another one of the (dis)advantages of Unix is the degree to
which you can customize the OS and installation, from simple
functions like making /tmp a separate partition to patching the
kernel to prevent some buffer overflows. Almost none of these
capabilities ship with Microsoft operating systems, or the
security tools that are provided are typically weak or flawed. </p>
<p>Just a note: Normally I don't write hoo-rah-rah articles full
of cheer and bonhomie, but every once in a while I do find a
company building something very useful/usable that warrants
covering. Next week I'll be going over some similar solutions for
Linux. Let's face it, the default tools are often not enough to
really secure a system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SecureStack </h2>
<p>It's a pity Microsoft doesn't harden its OS more. Most Unix
platforms provide some form of protection against buffer
overflows, and while they can typically be circumvented, the
protection does raise the bar for attackers. With Solaris we have
the file &quot;/etc/system&quot; with some interesting options
such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>set noexec_user_stack = 1 <br>
set noexec_stack_user_stack_log = 1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for Linux there is the ever-popular Solar Designers patch,
which can (among other things) help prevent buffer overflows.
Until recently nothing like this existed for Windows, but there
is now SecureStack. The cool thing is, you can get a free version
of SecureStack that will report buffer overflows, but not stop
them. </p>
<p>You would be well advised to at least install the free
version, as it will give you an indication of attacks, etc. For
any publicly accessible servers (such as IIS) or workstations, it
is most likely a good investment, as these systems are the most
likely to be exposed to hostile code. While it is unlikely
SecureStack will prevent 100% of buffer overflow-based attacks,
it will raise the bar and block many of the more common ones,
giving you a bit of safety between the time exploit code is
created, and a fix from Microsoft (or whichever vendor is in
question).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SecureNT</h2>
<p>Unless you seriously limit (or completely restrict) a user's
ability to install software and access the Control Panel, you
will be unable to prevent them from using their serial and
parallel ports. Even if you do lock this down, by disabling the
ports in Control Panel for example, any user that does need to
use the parallel port or serial port will either need access to
the Control Panel, or an admin to modify it. And of course you
have to remember to disable the port after you're done, something
that will likely be forgotten. </p>
<p>The same goes for removable media like floppy disks and
CD-ROMs. Of course, many users will have legitimate needs for
these, so any solution that controls access to them must easily
allow use. In Unix this is pretty simple: create a group of users
and assign them access to the appropriate device. </p>
<p>For Windows there is SecureNT (the name is a bit misleading
&#151; it works in Win9x as well). SecureNT lets you control
access to communications ports and removable media. You can
assign access to users and groups, centrally administer and
control it. SecureNT also has some other cool features, like
letting administrators specify that all data copied to a floppy
disk be also placed in a directory for later perusal (to make
sure confidential data hasn't been copied). </p>
<p>It's really too bad these features don't exist in Windows by
default. If an attacker wants to copy masses of data off your
network, it is often very simple to do so (use a floppy disk,
parallel port CD burner, etc.), and it's also very easy for users
to make &quot;mistakes&quot; like attaching a modem to their
workstation so they can dial in from home (and not have to go
through the hassle of getting access to the company dial-in
pool). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SecureEXE</h2>
<p>One of the easiest ways to hack into a system is to have a
batch file that creates a new administrator account, and get
someone with administrative access to run it (just one reason why
auditing and logging system events is so important). </p>
<p>This can be as simple as creating a desktop icon and telling
the help desk, &quot;every time I click on this I get a weird
error.&quot; They come by, log in, run it, and presto, the batch
file (or whatever Trojan) is run.</p>
<p>In addition, most companies want to control what users run.
This is typically done by using system policies; however, these
are very weak. Unless you give the full path to the executable,
all an attacker needs to do is name their program
&quot;notepad.exe&quot; (or something else the user is allowed to
run). Even with the full path name to the executable, an attacker
can overwrite a program the user is allowed to run with a Trojan
&#151; and this doesn't even touch on the problems with other
kinds of executable content such as DLLs. </p>
<p>The SecureExe system uses not only the name and path of the
program or file in question, but a SHA-1 digital signature,
stored on a server. The system uses a kernel module that
intercepts calls to things like DLLs, makes sure that the user in
question is allowed to run the item, and that the signature
matches. If the signature doesn't match, it won't be run and the
violation will be logged. </p>
<p>This is useful not only for preventing people from running
Trojans (accidentally or otherwise), but also for enforcing
software versions. (If someone upgrades, it will
&quot;break&quot; since the signatures do not match the old
profile.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is (in my opinion) all stuff that should be available by
default in Windows 9x/NT/2000. Unfortunately, it is not. The good
news is that if you require the extra security, it is available
&#151; although I have no idea what the pricing is. Anyway, if
you're paranoid you should probably contact them. If not, you
should probably download SecureStack, since the demo is free and
will tell you when someone exploits a buffer overflow.</p>
