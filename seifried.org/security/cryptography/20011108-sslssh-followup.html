<p>The original article: <a href="20011108-end-of-ssl-ssh.html">The
end of SSL and SSH?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>December 22 2000 - </strong>Well, I certainly managed
to kick over a hornet's next with my article &quot;The End of SSL
and SSH?&quot;. There were quite a few points I did not cover in
the article, many I did not think of, and some I trimmed. This
article will cover the reaction to SSL and SSH being
&quot;dead&quot;, as well as numerous implementation issues I did
not cover. The real issue is that technology cannot solve
problems completely. Anytime you put a new solution in you breed
new problems. This of course assumes you installed and are
maintaining the new solution correctly in the first place.
Vendors ships SSL and SSH, you turn it on, it works.
Unfortunately most people feel that they are then done and move
on to other problems, this is far from the truth. Both SSL and
SSH have numerous avenues an attacker can take, many of these
rely on the end user to make the right decision or have a secure
system, meaning a user can shoot themselves in the foot with
incredible ease. Pretty much any cryptographic
&quot;solution&quot; requires a degree of maintenance and
continued attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SSL</h2>
<p>Vendors ship server software such as SSL enabled web servers
but do little to make sure that users create certificates
properly or store them properly. While almost all webservers
support PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) encoded certificates
relatively few people use them since you must enter a passphrase
every time you start the server, making it impractical for many
such as virtual web hosting companies with dozens, hundreds or
even thousands of sites. These certificates can also be retrieved
from the memory of the server, this was found to be quite a bit
easier then originally thought. On the client side we have web
browsers with over a hundred certificates (I counted the root
certificates in Internet Explorer 5.5 and it came to 120 root
certificates). If any one of these certificates is compromised an
attacker would be able to create and sign certificates for any
name they wished to, making setup of fake sites trivial.
Attackers can easily present users with a new root certificate
and many users would inadvertently install, again allowing an
attacker to create arbitrary certificates. You can also modify
the certificate store with relative ease, since Windows 9x has no
file or registry permissions and the default settings in NT are
quite promiscuous this is relatively easy. The number of
potential paths an attacker can take to get a root certificate
into a users webbrowser are numerous and generally speaking quite
weak, most depend on the user to make the right decision, or have
secured their system properly, something that is relatively rare.
</p>
<p>If an attacker manages to break into a server that uses SSL to
secure services they can steal the certificate. If the
certificate is PEM encoded they will need to find the passphrase,
this can range from trivial to difficult in the extreme. They can
then use the certificate to setup a service that looks identical
to the original, with some DNS poisoning they can direct users
towards it. Now a good administrator is supposed to to notice
this and issue a certificate revocation. There is only one tiny
problem with this scenario. I have yet to see any web browser or
SSL enabled piece of software that checked for certificate
revocation by default, if they have the option it is usually
disabled by default. The reasons for this are many, the primary
one being that a piece of client software that checks for
revocation constantly will be slower and this of course will
annoy users.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For Netscape there is a built-in MIME type that cannot be
disabled which invokes the root CA installation code.&nbsp;
10:1 most people would click &quot;ok&quot; to install a root
CA if so prompted from a random web site. Now that's without
even doing anything nasty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even ignoring all these problems the simple fact is that SSL
certificates only identify the server to the user, they do not
authenticate it. This is a subtle but incredibly important
difference. My online bank is at tdbank.ca, td.ca on the other
hand is owned by someone else and banktd.ca is still free. I know
for example that www.openssl.org is the &quot;official&quot; site
for OpenSSL, but what about www.openssl.de? Shouldn't that be the
official site for OpenSSL translated into German? Well it turns
out that it isn't. Do you trust every single root certificate in
your webbrowser software? Have you even heard of &quot;IPS
SERVIDORES&quot; (ips.es), &quot;Saunalahden Serveri CA&quot;
(saunalahti.fi) or &quot;SERVICIOS DE CERTIFICACION -
A.N.C.&quot; (correo.com.uy)? I sure as heck haven't.</p>
<p>Of course an attacker can simply prevent you from ever making
it to the real web site, say you are shopping at example.org,
generally speaking the only part that would be SSL protected is
the actual order submission, meaning an attacker can do a man in
the middle attack and host a fake example.org web site. When you
hit submit to place your order they would simply direct it to
either a non secure site or their own secure site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SSH</h2>
<p>Drop 300 and fire for effect!</p>
<p>Now to deal with SSH. One huge SSH problem that someone
pointed out (lost your email address, sorry) is that very few
people expire their SSH keys. Another friend of mine pointed out
that to minimize the pain of different SSH keys on hosts the
local university copies keys between servers, in a way this makes
sense for ease of use, but has horrific security consequences.
SSH keys can last forever if you want, and the key itself has no
real binding to the host it resides on. Expiring and replacing
keys is difficult as it would look exactly like a man in the
middle attack to end users, &quot;Host key has changed,
blahblahblah&quot;. Implementing a PKI in SSH would negate many
of the benefits SSH offers, like ease of deployment since you
don't have to worry about setting up a key structure, just
individual keys. However something that could improve it would be
to use authentication protocols such as SRP or Kerberos that
offer a number of benefits. With Kerberos for example the server
authenticates itself to the client as well as the client to the
server, thus making man in the middle much harder to execute. SSH
also does not protect the key beyond file permissions, and has no
key revocation mechanism. If an attacker were to break into a
system and managed to retrieve the keys they would then be able
to execute a man in the middle with extreme ease. To make matters
worse the admin would have to somehow inform users (via email?
memo? phone?) that the keys had been compromised, there is no way
to do a key revocation. Contacting all the users for a large
installation (such as a university) would be painful to say the
least. Then there is the issue of protecting the known_hosts file
in UNIX, often times user directories are mounted via NFS, savvy
attackers could be able to modify the known_hosts file in transit
(like when your local ssh client requests it) allowing them to
execute a man in the middle attack successfully. This could be
somewhat mitigated by populating machines with a known_hosts file
in /etc however the maintenance and distribution of such a file
would be non trivial. </p>
<p>To make matters worse here are the messages that SecureCRT ( a
popular SSH client for Windows gives:</p>
<p>New key:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remote host (foo.example.org) has not been registered.<br>
Do you want to accept this key?<br>
Cancel | Accept Once | Accept &amp; Save</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changed key:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key you received from foo.example.org conflicts with
the previously registered key. <br>
Do you want to accept this key?<br>
Cancel | Accept Once | Accept &amp; Save</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No reason or explanation is given, unless the user has been
educated chances are they will simply accept they new or changed
key and go on with their work. Programs should flash, beep and
make the user aware of potentially bad things, the error message
for a changed key should be more like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key you received from foo.example.org is different
then the previously registered key. <br>
This may be due to an updated key on the server, or an attack
trying to subvert your ssh connection. <br>
You should contact your network help desk or system
administrator immediately and clarify the situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Programs should not make it easy for a user to let an attacker
execute an attack successfully. Remember, once an attacker gets
on to the system with a shell chances are they can gain
administrative access, meaning you will have a server to rebuild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SRP / Kerberos and others</h2>
<p>There are a number of protocols well suited to authentication.
Kerberos allows users to authenticate themselves to a server, and
vice versa based on a shared secret (usually the password).
Microsoft has recently started using Kerberos (with some
&quot;enhancements&quot;), letting you connect to Win2K servers
and then use things like IPSec in a reasonably secure manner.
Other ZKP (Zero Knowledge Protocols) protocols such as SRP allow
you to prove your identity to a server without ever sending any
sensitive data (like your password) over the network.
Implementing Kerberos, SRP or other ZKP protocols into SSH would
make man in the middle attacks more difficult. Unfortunately
these systems do not apply to SSL much since most SSL
transactions are www based and the user has no way of pre sharing
a secret with the merchant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PGP / GnuPG</h2>
<p>Many people pointed out PGP and GnuPG as being potential
add-on solutions. You can PGP / GnuPG sign SSH keys and
distribute them, well except for the small problem that very few
users have PGP or GnuPG capable mail programs and even fewer know
how to use them properly. Plus they would then have to take these
keys and import them into their known_hosts file (which even if
done correctly doesn't guarantee security). I would not classify
the use of PGP / GnuPG to &quot;add security&quot; to SSH or SSL
as a valid solution. There are also some nasty security problems
in older version of PGP and GnuPG that could allow an attacker to
subvert messages and keys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DNSSEC / IPSec</h2>
<p>This is something I mentioned as being a potential solution. I
phrased it badly, what I was aiming to get across was that the
use of DNSSEC could help prevent man in the middle attacks.
Currently DNS is completely insecure. DNS spoofing is a trivial
matter for attackers and most clients rely heavily on DNS (how
many people put the IP address of a server in the connection
setting, instead using the name?). If DNSSEC were properly
implemented and DNS servers were properly secured DNS spoofing
would be more difficult, obviously it has a long ways to go.
Widespread usage of IPSec would make man in the middle attacks
harder as well, hijacking TCP sessions would be a non trivial
exercise and most fail. However IPSec requires some form of
authentication, this can be achieved with a PKI (such as DNSSEC)
or shared secrets (such as Microsoft's Kerberos), obviously we
are a long ways from widespread opportunistic IPSec usage,
however in many environments IPSec can be deployed and would
help. Deploying it properly and maintaining it is left as an
exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Social issues</h2>
<p>Many attacks come from internal sources, the difficulty in
gaining some sort of access is negated by the simple fact that
the attacker already has legitimate access. Even if the
technology works properly the end user must still be educated and
security conscious as many attacks will ultimately end up
targeting the user (often the weakest link). Security protocols
and software are far from being the robust fail safe (as opposed
to fail open) systems that we seem to think they are. Good
security should be hard to disable or misuse, for example door
locks are extremely simple to use, locking a door is a simple act
and testing that it is locked is simple (I always try to turn my
door handle once I have locked it when leaving the apartment).
Security software should aim for this level of ease of user and
safety.</p>
