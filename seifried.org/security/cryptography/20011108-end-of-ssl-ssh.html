<p><strong>December 17, 2000 -</strong> Today [Yesterday if this
is posted on the 18th] dsniff 2.3 was released, why is this
important you ask? dsniff 2.3 allows you to exploit several
fundamental flaws in two extremely popular encryption protocols,
SSL and SSH. SSL and SSH are used to protect a large amount of
network traffic, from financial transactions with online banks
and stock trading sites to network administrator access to
secured hosts holding extremely sensitive data. Both SSH and SSL
use &quot;public key encryption&quot;, wherein their
vulnerabilities lay. They also rely heavily on the user to make
the right decisions when faced with an attack, and most users are
not educated enough to know what exactly they are dealing with
and usually make the wrong decision (how many times have we told
users not to open up executables emailed to them?). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Public key encryption</h2>
<p>There is one fundamental problem with establishing a secure,
encrypted connection over the Internet. No matter how you do it
at some point you must initiate the connection, over a public and
potentially hostile network. Ideally when two hosts establish a
connection they exchange public keys using a variety of
verifications processes (Diffie-Helman being an extremely popular
one for example) and each host properly receives the other's key.
Unfortunately since this must take place over a public and
usually insecure network it is possible for an attacker to
intercept the key exchange and subvert it. For example (this is
an oversimplified example but essentially correct) User Alice
wants to talk to server Bob, and Charlie want's to snoop in on
her session so he can read her mail. Alice initiates a connection
with Bob, Charlie sees this and intercepts it. Charlie talks to
Bob and pretends to be Alice, on the other side he talks to Alice
and pretends to be Bob. Alice sends her public key out, which
Charlie intercepts, Charlie then sends his own public key to Bob.
Bob then sends his public key to Alice, which is again
intercepted by Charlie, Charlie sends his own public key on to
Alice. Now when Alice signs data using her secret key and then
encrypts data to Bob using Bob's public key she will actually be
using Charlie's public key, meaning Charlie can decrypt the data.
Charlie would then receive the data, decrypt it using his secret
key, strip off Alice's signature, sign the data using his secret
key and then encrypt the data using Bob's public key and send it
to Bob. Thus Alice thinks she is talking directly to Bob in a
secure manner when in fact Charlie is in the middle intercepting
the communications, able to monitor it and also to modify the
content. This means that Charlie can not only grab Alice's
username and password but can inject commands in, and the trail
would point to Alice. Bob is in the same situation as Alice,
blissfully unaware that Charlie is about to format the main
harddrive.</p>
<p>Since this problem is so fundamental to public key encryption
there have been many schemes to foil an attacker like Charlie.
With SSL the most common solution is to use signed certificates.
The server has a certificate containing it's public key, and
information such as the server name, and organization responsible
for it, this &quot;certificate&quot; of information is then sign
by the secret key of a trusted third party (such as Verisign).
The trusted third party's key is then usually built in to
software such as web browsers, if an attacker can subvert the web
browser and modify the certificate they would also be able to
redirect information before it gets encrypted so the risk
assumption is that the user will have trusted software. When the
user tries to establish an encrypted session with the server they
can verify that the certificate that the server sent them is
indeed valid and belongs who it claims to. Unfortunately there is
a missing part in this equation. While SSL requires that the
server authenticate to the user it is usually option for the user
to authenticate to the server. And since so very few users own
personal certificates it is exceedingly rare for a user to be
able to prove their identity to the server in question, leaving
the connection open to attack. The same general problems exist
for SSH however, instead of certificates however SSH simply uses
a secret and public key, and since they are generally not signed
it is trivial for an attacker to sit in the middle and intercept
the connection. If this is the first time you are connecting to a
host and do not have the server's public key locally you will be
non the wiser, if you do have the server's public key you will
generally receive a warning like &quot;warning, server's key has
changed, continue?&quot;, most users will hit Yes. </p>
<p>I also wrote several articles last year regarding SSL and
other authentication protocols, the URL's are listed at the
bottom and they discuss how an attacker could go about
successfully. Unfortunately unless both parties have some
pre-established connection (servers knows the user's password, or
they use signed certificates from a trusted CA) any
authentication system will probably be susceptible to a man in
the middle attack (although people are working on better
systems).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can't they fix it?</h2>
<p>So why haven't these problems been fixed? Well without some
trusted third party to sign keys and certificates (providing a
somewhat secure path to establish a secure connection over) the
connection must be established by two parties that do not trust
each other (that is they cannot prove their identity to each
other securely). There are newer key exchange algorithms that
claim to solve many of the problems inherent in these
transactions, however most are aimed at services where the user
is logging in to a server, thus the server and the client both
either know the username and the password associated with that
username or can otherwise verify it. Unfortunately these
protocols do not work so well for SSL transactions which are used
on a massive scale (almost anytime people are required to send or
receive sensitive information via the WWW SSL is used, although
in to many cases it is not). </p>
<p>To make matters worse the very foundation of modern networks
is generally insecure, using protocols designed 20 or 30 years
ago in an environment where security was not as much of a
concern. Lower level protocols like ARP (Address Resolution
Protocol, used to map IP addresses to MAC hardware addresses on
local networks) contain no provisions for security. Moving up the
scale TCP-IP and UDP provide no built in encryption or
authentication, and it will be a very long time before there is
widespread use of IPSec. DNS is also generally insecure, anyone
can provide false answers with no real way to verify the data
currently, however DNSSEC is start to appear, and with the .mil
domain pledging to use it should help matters somewhat. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Enter dsniff</h2>
<p>dsniff is a sophisticated set of programs that combined with
other standard utilities like tcpdump (a standard packet sniffer)
allow you to monitor and redirect network traffic so you can
analyze it. While most packet sniffers can monitor network data
very few are capable or rerouting traffic or analyzing encrypted
data. The utilities dsniff provides allow you redirect network
traffic at a number of levels. First of all is the local network,
if you are on a hub or switch you can use arpspoof to hijack
other machines IP addresses, if the switch is secured and ignore
arp packets you can use macof to flood it, some switches when
flooded revert to hub mode, thus allowing you to monitor the
targets network traffic. Using the dnsspoof utility you can forge
DNS replies and redirect DNS names to arbitrary IP addresses
(ones you control), and with tcpkill you can block TCP
connections to machines by spoofing packets that tell the machine
to close the connection. Once you have got the traffic going to a
machine you control you can use the suite of sniffing tools to
extract passwords, message traffic, files and so on from network
traffic. With the latest version of dsniff you also gain the
ability to intercept and monitor SSH (protocol version 1) and SSL
connections using the vulnerabilities discussed above. Following
is a list of dsniff utilities:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>arpspoof - spoof arp entries</li>
<li>dnsspoof - forge dns replies</li>
<li>macof - flood using mac addresses</li>
<li>tcpkill - block tcp connections</li>
<li>tcpnice - slow down tcp connections</li>
<li>dsniff - all purpose sniffer</li>
<li>filesnarf - NFS sniffer</li>
<li>mailsnarf - email sniffer</li>
<li>msgsnarf - IM sniffer</li>
<li>urlsnarf - web url sniffer</li>
<li>webspy - lets you surf in synch with your target</li>
<li>sshmitm - SSH protocol 1 attack</li>
<li>webmitm - HTTP / HTTPS attack</li>
</ul>
<p>And it is now available in a convenient source ball package
that an attacker can easily compile and use. Most of these tools
are available form other sources, or have been hand coded by
attackers, however until now they were difficult to track down
and use, which gave SSL and SSH a bit of respite. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What can you do about this?</h2>
<p>Ignoring the problem would be one way, but that probably won't
work in the long run. Without major restructuring of the SSH and
SSL protocols there is very little that can be done to
&quot;fix&quot; them. The best course of action is to educate
users to the dangers that attackers pose, and how to recognize
when an attack may be taking place. Setting up a lab or actually
running the software and showing users and management their
passwords would be one way to encourage them to pay attention,
although make sure you get permissions and people are warned in
advance. Maintaining the overall security of your network is also
a good idea, if an attacker can't get in this will prevent them
from many internal attacks. If you are using SSL for secure
transactions you should probably consider setting up a CA (or
outsourcing it) and issuing SSL certificates op users as well as
smart cards readers to store them securely. The simplest solution
with SSH would be to stop supporting protocol version 1, moving
to protocol 2 shouldn't be to difficult as OpenSSH supports it,
and most free clients as well (although not all). You can also
use one time password schemes, doing so with a secure token would
greatly minimize the risk involved, although session hijacking
would still be possible and it would probably be more difficult
then switching over to SSH protocol 2, however it is only a
matter of time before someone improves upon dsniff to support SSH
protocol 2. Implementing lower level security protocols such as
DNSSEC should help (assuming it is done properly), this will
prevent attackers from spoofing DNS replies (although rerouting
traffic with ARP spoofing on local networks will still be
possible). Other options include using IPSec and making it
mandatory for workstations and servers, with a strong
authentication system it would be much more difficult for
attackers to spoof traffic or sniff it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>Hopefully this will spurn on the adoption of secure network
protocols such as DNSSEC and IPSec. It is unlikely that anyone
will discover some new mathematical property that can be used to
make a secure authentication protocol that won't be susceptible
to the same problems as SSH and SSL given the same circumstances.
Right now network encryption at the session level is seen as a
panacea that will solve all your problems, but like any solution
it breeds new problems. Admitedly these new problems tend to be a
lot harder to exploit then the old ones, but they are sitll
exploitable. </p>
