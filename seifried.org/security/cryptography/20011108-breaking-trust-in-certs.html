<p>For a while now I've been writing articles about SSL,
outlining various problems, and why SSL in general is a poor
solution that should be improved (before we start doing things
like online voting, yikes). The whole premise of certificates is
that multiple parties trust a central certificate authority (CA),
so when Alice wants to talk to Bob they can verify each others
certificates through the CA, in theory proving that they are
actually taking to the person that they claim to be. This CA has
a very important job, especially so with the use of X.509
certificates (currently the most common for SSL, smartcards and
so on). Unlike PGP or GnuPG for example where you can have
multiple entities sign a certificate (such as your mother, your
boss, the post office, etc.) with X.509 you are limited to one
only. Because X.509 certificates can only be signed by one entity
you ultimately have to place all your trust in the entity that
signed it. </p>
<p>Chances are any CA that is setup to sign certificates will
sign a lot of certificates, once they have built the
infrastructure it essentially costs them nothing to sign
certifications. In fact the only major cost for signing a
certificate would be verifying that the end party asking for a
signed certificate is indeed who they claim to be. Verisign (who
owns Thawte, among other companies) now has the majority of the
market (the last number is saw was over 95%), and they have made
at least one extremely large mistake. In January of this year
they issued two certificates to &quot;Microsoft
Corporation&quot;, unfortunately the person that got these
certificates did not work for Microsoft. To quote the security
bulletin issued by Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The certificates could be used to sign programs, ActiveX
controls, Office macros, and other executable content. Of
these, signed ActiveX controls and Office macros would pose
the greatest risk, because the attack scenarios involving
them would be the most straightforward. Both ActiveX controls
and Word documents can be delivered via either web pages or
HTML mails. ActiveX controls can be automatically invoked via
script, and Word documents can be automatically opened via
script unless the user has applied the Office Document Open
Confirmation Tool. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is a pretty bad situation. But things get worse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Verisign has revoked the certificates, and they are listed
in Verisign&#146;s current Certificate Revocation List (CRL).
However, because Verisign&#146;s code-signing certificates do
not specify a CRL Distribution Point (CDP), it is not
possible for any browser&#146;s CRL-checking mechanism to
download the Verisign CRL and use it. Microsoft is developing
an update that rectifies this problem. The update package
includes a CRL containing the two certificates, and an
installable revocation handler that consults the CRL on the
local machine, rather than attempting to use the CDP
mechanism. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh dear. The sad part is even if Verisign had included a CDP
field in the certificate it wouldn't have mattered much since
Microsoft doesn't support certificate revocation very well yet.</p>
<p>See, certificates sometimes need to be revoked, perhaps your
laptop gets stolen, you accidentally expose it, or someone that
had access to it is fired and you don't completely trust them.
This is supposed to be achieved through a &quot;Certificate
Revocation List&quot;, basically a list of certificates that have
been revoked which is signed by the CA (so an attacker can't
issue a fake revocation). Well this is all fine and dandy in
theory but there are significant problems:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>In each certificate there needs to be a field telling you
where to look for the revocation, the CDP, as yet there
are no large central repositories available for public
use, and only a handful (or less) of vendors that even
bother to put the field in their certificates (Baltimore
Entrust is the only I know of).</li>
<li>CA's need to create massive, redundant and extremely
secure CDP's (having one server just won't do it). The
response time for checking if a certificate is revoked or
not needs to be very fast (even if you only check once a
day).</li>
<li>People need to turn on &quot;check for certificate
revocation&quot; in their SSL enabled software (web
browsers, operating system, email clients, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these problems can be easily solved, there are
hundreds of thousands of certificates floating around with no
easy way to find where a certificate's revocation can be found,
many of these certificates have reasonably short life span, but
not all of them. In future hopefully all vendors will issue
certificates with CDP fields, however this hasn't happened yet
and isn't likely to happen anytime soon. The CA's then need to
build massive infrastructures to run their CDP's and support
CRL's properly, however this costs real money, so I doubt any
CA's will be doing this soon (if ever). Once the CDP's and CRL's
are built and available users then need to use them, turning on
&quot;check for certificate revocation&quot; in all their
software (it is unlikely vendors will turn this on by default). </p>
<p>Why am I being so pessimistic? Simply put users will not
demand these features. CA's will perpetuate the myth that
certificates can be trusted and are suitable for use in business
transactions, contracts and so on. Most software vendors have not
even provided the capabilities, until recently if at all to check
for revoked certificates, so even with CA's adding CDP fields it
won't help much until people are using software capable of
utilizing it. Between software vendors and CA's I don't think the
situation is likely to improve anytime soon (if at all). </p>
