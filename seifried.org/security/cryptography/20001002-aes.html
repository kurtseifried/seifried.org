<p>About 25 years ago the US NBS (National Board of Standards,
renamed to NIST) put out a call for an encryption algorithm,
unfortunately back then there wasn't a whole lot of public
cryptography going on (they mostly worked for the NSA). Another
call was put out in the federal register to which IBM responded
with a algorithm called &quot;Lucifer&quot;. This is where things
get interesting. Originally Lucifer used a 128 bit key, however
after the NSA got involved the key length was reduced to 56 bits,
making it 4,722,366,482,869,645,213,696 times easier to brute
force the key (2^72). This is rather interesting because it made
it possible for the EFF to design and build a custom chip that
had one purpose, to brute force DES keys. For less then $250,000
they engineered, and manufactured a machine that could run
through the entire 56 bit key space in a matter of days (less
then 5 days on average). This was accomplished by a small public
effort and completed in January of 1999. This is especially
interesting since the NSA is many years ahead of public
cryptographic efforts (the NSA is the worlds largest employer of
mathematicians). People realized that DES on it's own was secure
against casual attackers, but not against a reasonably determined
attacker, so 3DES was created, basically 2 56 bit keys are used
to encrypt the data, first the A key, then the B key, then the A
key again. This makes the resulting effort required to brute
force it exponentially higher, unless there is some fundamental
flaw in DES it probably isn't possible to brute force it. This of
course creates a new problem, the resulting encryption and
decryption is extremely slow and computationally expensive. NIST
responded to this several years ago by calling for a replacement
for DES, the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which has now
been chosen and announced.</p>
<p><strong>AES</strong></p>
<p>AES must be faster, stronger and cheaper to implement then
DES. It had to be fast when implemented in software, and small so
it could be implemented in hardware (token cards/etc). It has to
be highly resistant to attack since like DES it will be in
service for a long time (to put it in perspective UNIX measures
time in seconds since 1970, the &quot;epoch&quot;). After a
lengthy process of many submissions it was whittled down to 5
finalists. At this point these algorithms are reasonably safe,
they have been analyzed in great detail, and while some concerns
have been found in most cases they are minor or easily solved
(i.e. using more rounds). The algorithm chosen was Rijndael.</p>
<p>So what exactly are the differences between these various
algorithms? In general they are all capable algorithms, however
various trade offs are required. If you want the algorithm to be
fast and secure it'll be more expensive to implement in low end
hardware. MARS is extremely fast on high end hardware and most
computers, but requires a much higher gate count then the other
algorithms being considered for use on smartcards. The cost of
implementation on smartcards and so forth is an important factor
in choosing the AES finalist since the number of smartcards and
other small devices that will be deployed using AES is
significant (tens of millions over the next decade or two). At
the same time the algorithm must be able to encrypt and decrypt
many gigabits/second (imagine several thousand clients or sites
connecting to a large site such as a central office). As network
encryption becomes increasingly common (IPSec is just starting to
take off) the need for an algorithm that can be implemented in
hardware and is extremely fast is critical, especially since this
algorithm will be in use for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>MARS</strong></p>
<p>MARS is from IBM, and surprisingly enough is not the one most
similar to the original DES. MARS is designed with reasonably
high end hardware in mind and is extremely fast. This means that
for implementation on smart cards it will require about 70,000
gates, quite a bit more then the other candidates. On a 200mhz
Intel Pentium Pro IBM claims that MARS can handle 65
megabits/sec, and with a custom hardware chip containing ~393,000
gates it will be able to handle 8 gigabits per second. MARS also
supports keys from 128 to 448 bits, larger then some of the other
candidates. </p>
<p><strong>Serpent</strong></p>
<p>Serpent is an international effort between Cambridge
University, Haifa Israel and University of Bergen, Norway.
Serpent is basically an improved version of DES, while not as
sexy as other algorithms it is based on extremely well understood
principles and has withstood a lot of analysis (20+ years).
Serpent supports key sizes from 40 bits to 256 (I'm not sure if
it supports larger keys but the documentation I have read does
not seem to indicate it). Compared to other AES candidates
Serpent is relatively &quot;slow&quot;, they estimate 14.7
megabits/sec on a Pentium 200, significantly slower then MARS.
However with dedicated hardware requiring around 100,000 gates,
unfortunately no numbers on speed were given.</p>
<p><strong>RC6</strong></p>
<p>RC6 is from RSA laboratories, one major difference between it
and other AES candidates is that it does not use look up tables,
significantly reducing it's size (an important factor for
smartcards). Unfortunately RC6 appears extremely slow when
compared to others, an implementation written in assembly
language on a Pentium 200 it would encrypt and decrypt at just
over 12 megabits/sec, even slower then Serpent. However because
of it's use of simple operations a hardware based implementation
should be capable of over a gigabit per second, while this is
more then sufficient for most current applications it could prove
to be a problem in 10 years. RC6 also supports keysizes larger
then 256 bits.</p>
<p><strong>Rijndael</strong></p>
<p>Rijndael was designed by a Dutch bank that handles a lot of
ATMs, and it shows a lot of bias in this regard. Rijndael's size
on 8 bit processors is quite impressive, code length is just over
1k, and ram requirements are 52 bytes when using a 256 bit key
(less for smaller keys). The numbers they provide for speed on a
Pentium 200 are rather odd, with ANSI C they claim 27
megabits/sec with a 128 bit key, and 19.8 megabits/sec with a 256
bit key. Using Visual C++ however the numbers increase by about
250%, 70.5 megabits/sec with a 128 bit key, and 51.2 megabits/sec
with a 256 bit key. Unfortunately I have not been able to find
any information on the number of gates needed to implement this
algorithm in hardware, nor any performance figures, but from the
general design and speeds on a Pentium it sounds like it would
compare favorably to the other candidates. </p>
<p><strong>Twofish</strong></p>
<p>Twofish is an American effort, primarily by Counterpane
Systems (Bruce Schneiers company, currently moving into managed
security services). Twofish supports key sizes over 256 bits, and
is extremely fast, producing 90 megabits/sec on a Pentium 200
(although the keysize associated with this is not mentioned). On
smart cards it requires just over 2k and can be implemented in as
little as 14,000 gates, larger implementations of up to 80,000
gates being faster. The numbers for a dedicated piece of hardware
with 30,000 gates running at 150 MHz claim 1.2 gigabits/sec,
using more gates and high clock speeds faster speeds can be
achieved. Like most of Bruce Schneiers work it is
&quot;clean&quot;, they did not try to &quot;push the
envelope&quot;, sticking to reasonably tried and true methods,
and allowing for various safety margins. </p>
<p>As far as speed goes it looks like MARS and Twofish are well
ahead of the rest, and MARS appears to be the only one with
support for keys larger then 256 bits (which counts in it's favor
for &quot;future proofing&quot; in my opinion). Serpent is
enviable because of it's basic design, using DES as it's base it
uses extremely well prooven techniques. Rijndael and RC6 both
look very attractive for smart cards, however they may not scale
to well to high throughput situations, especially using 256 bit
keys. The choice of Rijndael is reasonable given that none of
these algorithms are &quot;perfect&quot; (to gain speed you trade
off size, and so on). Hopefully no-one will find any significant
problems in it since it looks like we'll be using this for the
next few decades.</p>
