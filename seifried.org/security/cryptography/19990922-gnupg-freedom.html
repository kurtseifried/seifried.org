<p>Additional note: as of fall 2001 the commercial PGP has
essentially been dead with only a few critical bug fixes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>September 22, 1999&nbsp;-&nbsp;W</b>ell last week caused a
bit of a stir, which is good. Hopefully this week will really get
people thinking. As you may or may not have heard, GnuPG 1.0 has
been released. If you haven't heard, GnuPG is a GPL'ed
cryptographic program that uses no patented algorithms, and
happens to be perfectly compatible with PGP. I interviewed Werner
Koch (via email), the heart and soul of the GnuPG project.&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Kurt:</b>&nbsp; Why did you feel the need to write GnuPG?</p>
<p><b>Werner:</b> I think it started at a conference in
Aachen/Germany where Richard Stallman asked the non European
Programmers to work on crypto software, now that the
Diffie-Hellmann was void (about fall 1997).</p>
<p>A few weeks later I got bored by the programming tasks I was
doing at that time and suddenly started to write a parser for PGP
keyrings. After I could decrypt PGP 2 messages I remembered, that
a PGP like program has been on the GNU task list for a long time.
I contacted them and started to write a PGP based on ElGamal (a
Diffie Hellmann variant). And it was quite interesting as I have
been interested in cryptography for quite a while.</p>
<p>Another important reason was the fact, that PGP 5 was not free
anymore and the available Unix version was quite bad.</p>
<p><b>Kurt:</b> Do you think people are actually concerned enough
about &quot;freedom&quot; to switch to GnuPG? Do you have any
plans for public education/advertising this?</p>
<p><b>Werner:</b> To face the reality, most folks are concerned
whether they can get stuff for free (beer). And many folks want
to stay with PGP 2 because of all the rumors on key escrowing in
PGP 5 and such things.</p>
<p>I think that in the near future many will realize that only
free (speech) software can guarantee that there are no hidden
backdoors. And to take it further, a free operating system is
also useful for such software, because a OS has so much power
over the running applications, that it must be technically well
designed and open for public analysis.</p>
<p>We are currently evaluating ways to promote and offer GnuPG to
the broad masses. This means that we need a Windows version (I
did a first working version with a real random number generator
and internationalization yesterday), a front-end for key
management and plugins for some mailers.</p>
<p><b>Kurt:</b> With public domain software like GnuPG, and other
GPL/BSD licensed strong crypto, are you worried that countries
might remove the portions of their crypto laws (such as Germany,
Canada, and the Wassenaar agreement) that allow public domain
crypto to be exported freely?</p>
<p><b>Werner:</b> It may happen but I don't believe it. According
to lawyer of the &quot;Innenministerium&quot; (Home Office) they
tend to change the definition of &quot;public domain&quot; in the
Wassenaar agreement to be more like &quot;academic research
results&quot; which means that they will basically allow software
which is published under the GPL (He did exactly know the
contents of the GPL). So at least it will be legal to put such
software onto FTP servers.</p>
<p>I don't know of any thoughts to regulate technical advices or
support like it is done in the U.S. I do not know what will
happen in the UK, they have always different politics than the
rest of the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So what does this mean?</b></p>
<p>Most countries that have non-restrictive crypto policies allow
public domain software to be exported without any restrictions or
review. This has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of
crypto software (especially GPL and BSD licensed stuff) being
written. Linux and most versions of BSD now support IPSec, they
all support SSL, and they now have a free (as in free beer, and
free speech) PGP replacement. The arguments used by most
government agencies don't hold much water, as any naughty person
(read terrorist) can now simply download strong crypto for free
over the Internet (not that this would stop them buying US
software and making a million copies in any case).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two kinds of crypto laws, either they are
restrictive and impose limits, or they allow anything. You simply
cannot have it both ways. The US recently &quot;relaxed&quot;
their crypto policy, however no provisions were made to relax
controls on public domain software. In addition to this they
still require you to submit your software for a &quot;one time
technical analysis&quot;, it is unclear whether you must wait for
a yes before shipping, if so this would provide an effective way
to deny exports. The official reasoning behind this is that
terrorist organizations and criminals (of course they would have
to be outside the US) might get ahold of strong US crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would seem that the barn door is wide open, anyone with an
internet connection can download OpenBSD, Linux and IPSec, or a
copy of GnuPG (all written in &quot;free&quot; countries), and
use them to encrypt their data. This might encourage various
governments to loosen crypto policies, as they are obsolete in a
world where a small group of people can create and distribute
software to millions of people at very little cost. On the other
hand it might lead to a crack down on public domain software,
which might be to late at this point, due to the plethora of
software currently available. Hopefully business will bring
pressure to bear on governments to loosen crypto laws, in Britain
key escrow was successfully killed by businesses lobbying the
government.</p>
<p>In addition to this the majority of GPL and BSD licensed
software is free, as in free beer. To many people, issues such as
the freedom to take the code and improve it are immaterial (try
explaining the GPL to business people, it's usually a painful
process). Smart management will realize that the initial purchase
price of software is usually a minor portion of the total amount
spent, but if GnuPG has the same interface, and plug-in
capabilities as the commercial version, in the long run they can
save a lot of money (currently the commercial version of PGP is
$40 USD a copy).&nbsp;This means that any well written open
source software will spread like kudzu (a vine like plant), due
to the fact that it tends to fit the needs, and budgets of
people.</p>
<p><b>So one day we'll have strong crypto in every computer?</b></p>
<p>I sure hope so. Computer security has been, until recently,
seriously ignored by most people. We are moving towards a
computing environment where everything is connected to the
Internet (I'm not 100% sure why, but it seems to be happening).
This causes some pretty fundamental problems, simple things like
credentials (user names and passwords typically) flowing across
insecure networks, and the simple fact that if you are connected
to the Internet, and I'm connected to the Internet, I can get at
your computer(s). A good example of this is the SANS
&quot;Universal SSH&quot; project, it's ultimate goal to get all
universities to use SSH to secure login's, and other network
activity. So why should you care (unless of course you are an
administrator at a university). The simple fact is most
universities are very insecure, and are used as bases to launch
attacks on other systems. It makes sense to encourage the use of
strong crypto, as it will potentially save a lot of time and
money, and possibly prevent security incidents for other people
(like you).</p>
<p><b>Hey, I wanted to read about GnuPG!</b></p>
<p>When I wrote this article I didn't want to focus to much on
the technical side of GnuPG, but I realized if I didn't people
would hunt me down and force me to. GnuPG for Win32 is not yet
ready (this is something they are working on), however the UNIX
versions (at least the Linux one) work great. I generated a
keypair &quot;gpg --gen-key&quot;, specifying a 4096 bit sized
key (because it recommended 2048 as a maximum), and it took a
long to calculate (like it warned me). I then exported my public
key &quot;gpg --export --armor&quot;, tossed it into PGPi for
windows (I figured that would be a good interoperability test),
and successfully signed, verified, encrypted and decrypted some
files. To get help for gpg simply type &quot;gpg -h&quot; or
&quot;man gpg&quot;, if you've ever executed &quot;pgp -h&quot;
or &quot;man pgp&quot; you know what to expect. The only real
difference is that unlike &quot;modern&quot; pgp there is only
the &quot;gpg&quot; command, whereas pgp has &quot;pgpk&quot;,
&quot;pgpo&quot;, &quot;pgpe&quot;, etc, this is of course a
trivial detail (and I actually prefer having just
&quot;gpg&quot;). Basically there isn't much to say, other then
it works as it should, and you might want to read the man page,
but I wouldn't really bother if you're at all familiar with
pgp.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Free crypto software, written in &quot;free&quot; countries is
good. If you are using PGP under UNIX I'd highly recommend
switching to GnuPG. Le Fini. I'd also like to thank Werner Koch
for doing the interview.</p>
