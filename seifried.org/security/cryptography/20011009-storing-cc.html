<p>This question came up recently on a mailing list and at first
glance I thought &quot;no problem&quot; but upon further
reflection it turned out to be a lot harder then expected. The
first assumption to be made is that the Database you are storing
the numbers in will not be 100% secure, outside attacker, inside
attacker, data entry people jotting down numbers, and so forth.
The obvious solution is to encrypt the data, use a strong one way
hash like SHA1 and be done with it. This problem is very
difficult especially if you plan to store the data for a long
time and use it to run statistical programs to help predict fraud
rates and so on since you must be sure that whatever encrypted
string of data that represents the card is the same in all cases
(meaning you cannot use random salt values to help hash it).</p>
<p>So what's wrong with this rosy picture? Several things. The
amount of actual data on a credit card is very limited, you have
a number, valid from date, expiry date, and a name. In many cases
the name on the card will be different, on my 3 Visa's the name
is different on each one (MR or no MR, middle initial or no
middle initial). People's names also change, they get married and
so forth. If we are interested in only tracking the individual
cards then we could use the name in the hash, however if the name
changes on the credit card it would break.</p>
<p>The primary problem is that credit card numbers are not very
long, and are quite predictable. VISA for example uses a 16 digit
number for the card, and a 4 digit expiry date, so that's 10^20
(or about 2^66) right? Wrong. The first 4 digit block is a bank
identifier, I have 3 Visa's from the same bank, the id code is
(for argument's sake) 1234. It is easy to collect the codes for
major banks (In Canada there are about 4, in the US around 100)
so instead of 10,000 combinations it's more like 200-300 (which
would cover most credit cards). The next 12 digits are
pseudo-random, they do conform to a variety of algorithms used to
generate the card numbers. These card number generating
algorithms can be found online, using these would great reduce
the search space again from 10^12, for arguments sake we'll say
10, so that's 10^11 possibilities. The last 4 digits, the expiry
date would indicate a possibility of 10,000 values, except the
first two digits will usually be 00 to 04 (most cards expire in 3
years or so, and we're not really interested in expired ones),
the next 2 digits are always 01 to 12, so that's around 48
possibilities, quite a bit less then 10,000. So for a total we
have 300 times 10^11 times 48, for around 1,440,000,000,000,000
possibilities, or slightly less then 2^50. If we include the name
then there is the prefix (MR, MRS, MS or none), a first name, a
middle initial, and a last name (although the middle initial
seems optional). Using the name as well we can assume about 5,000
popular first names, 27 possible middle initials (a to z, and
none), and 5,000 popular last names, which increases the search
space and memory requirements and attacker would need to brute
force the problem. </p>
<p>When hashing data for storage you want data with as much
entropy and randomness as possible, something credit cards lack.
Unfortunately if you want to store them you probably want to
store the bank prefix, definitely the number, and NOT the expiry
date (the expiry date is so predictable it would actually help
attackers more then it would hinder them). It would be a good
idea to also use the name on the card, but of course if the
person changes their name a new hash for the card will be
computed and you will not be able to link it against their past
history. There are also methods to further obfuscate the data,
you could use SHA1 to hash the data, and then blowfish for
example, and while it would make life a little more difficult for
an attacker chances are because of the extreme simplicity of the
data it might weaken the process. When storing data, especially a
lot of entries like the hash value of the card you probably want
to use a fixed length data, algorithms like SHA1 will produce
this for you. </p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>There is no easy solution. However with companies like
American express rolling out smartcards (American Express
&quot;Blue&quot;) the storage of this data will become much
simpler. The fundamental flaw in credit cards is that the
identifier, the piece of data used to authorize a transaction,
and the data used to verify that transaction are all the same!
With smartcards based on public/private key encryption you can
safely store the person's public key, use it to verify
transactions they have authorized, and use it to identify the
person/card (since the chances of two people having the same
public key are remote). So keep in mind when companies claim to
be storing your credit card numbers securely, it's a lot harder
then it looks (i.e. it is easy to screw up).</p>
