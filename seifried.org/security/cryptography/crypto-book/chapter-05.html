<p>Of course like any security measures cryptographic software is
only effective if used properly, on a secure system. If you have
been infected with Back orifice, and someone has copied all your
public and private keys, as well as logged your keystrokes and
found the passphrases to access these keys, no matter how strong
the encryption is it'll be useless. On a UNIX system things are
difficult if you are a user since the super user (root) has full
access and can easily access your keys/log keystrokes (this goes
for an attacker that gains super user access to). Securing UNIX
is a very large topic, there is a wealth of information available
however, but it revolves around the same principles of any
operating system. </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Keep software up to date, this is how most remote attacks
succeed</li>
<li>Use an anti-virus scanner, and keep it up to date</li>
<li>Do not run mystery attachments, especially executable
ones or data formats that can contain executable code
(VBScript, Word documents, Excel files, executables,
etc.)</li>
<li>Run as little software as possible, if you don't need
something to get your job done, remove it, it won't be a
problem that way</li>
<li>Run software with as little privilege as possible, for
example instead of Sendmail (which runs all as root)
consider Postfix or Qmail (which run most of their
processes as user accounts)</li>
<li>Keep the machine physically secure if possible, use BIOS
passwords and so on to secure access to the machine </li>
</ul>
<p>Most modern encryption systems use pretty solid cryptography,
most of the failings are in management of encryption keys,
sessions, or other related tasks. Many users will store their
encryption keys in accessible areas, with poor passphrases. When
protected by a good passphrase (&quot;L3t's g0 t0 7he b3ach and
have some sandy good hotdogs with pumpkins and
9868lovermonkey&quot;) they are very hard to recover, however if
protected by a poor passphrase (&quot;sekret&quot;) they are
easily recovered. Of course very few people will use long
passphrases since they are difficult to remember and type in. One
of the most effective methods for protecting encryption keys/etc
is to use an offline system (i.e. no network/modem/etc) and
transfer data to it via floppy/zip/jaz/tape drive, then
encrypt/decrypt/etc as necessary and move the finished form to a
networked machine to send it. This is how root level keys are
generally protected (requiring physical access to the machine
makes security significantly simpler).</p>
<p>Another consideration is Open verses Closed source crypto.
OpenSource crypto programs can (and are) reviewed by
knowledgeable people that are paranoid and want to make sure they
work as advertised. Closed source programs have a higher
probability of containing back doors or other problems
(intentional or otherwise), although rare it has occurred. </p>
