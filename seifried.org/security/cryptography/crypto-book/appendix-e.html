<hr>
<p>RSA is one of the corner stones of modern cryptography.
Numerous protocols use RSA, one of the most widespread being SSL
(Secure Sockets Layer), the de facto standard for encryption of
WWW traffic, and to a lesser degree for protocols such as POP and
IMAP (among others). Unfortunately RSA is patented in the USA
(until Sept 20th, 2000), resulting in a variety of
restrictions/issues. You cannot use RSA without a license, for
things such as web browsers this is not a problem as
Netscape/Microsoft/etc. have licensed RSA components, for server
software however you typically have to pay for SSL enabled
services (such as secure web servers). However there is an
implementation of RSA called RSAREF (RSA Reference), which has
several problems, you cannot develop it, you can only make bug
fixes, so speed wise it lags well behind other RSA
implementations, and it has had a number of serious security
problems (which have since been fixed). RSAREF used for free,
however not in any situation on which you charge for access to
the service using RSAREF which is perfectly reasonable, until you
consider institutions such as universities. Universities charge
tuition to students, and a portion of this goes to paying for
network services, so legally speaking universities cannot use
RSAREF (although several do, some, like columbia.edu have gone so
far as to create encryption software for use on campus). US
businesses are mostly in the clear, for internal operations there
are typically no fees associated with access, however for
e-commerce servers, and for services that ISP's and other network
providers provide you cannot legally use RSAREF. The RSA company
is also quite zealous about protecting their patents, so if they
find a business using RSA or RSAREF improperly (i.e. they have
not paid for it when they should) they will go after you, so
before using RSAREF please consult a lawyer. The good news (as
stated before) is that the patent should expire in September of
2000, and that outside the US using RSAREF/etc is perfectly
legal.</p>
