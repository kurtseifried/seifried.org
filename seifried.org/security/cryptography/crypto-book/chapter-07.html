<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Email is the killer application that made the Internet grow at
first (the second killer application would probably be the web
which makes sharing information on a one to many basis easy).
Currently several billion messages a day are passed over the
Internet. It is no longer uncommon to get 20 or even 200 emails a
day for some people, a number that would have been quite amazing
a few years ago. The percentage of email that is actually
readable by an attacker, or that can be manipulated while in
transit with little chance of discover is close to 100%. </p>
<p>There are two main issues with email encryption, this first is
digitally signing email, the second is encrypting email. With
digital signatures on an email you can prove the sender identity,
and that the message was not tampered with while in transit.
Imagine if you were to send a price quote via email to someone,
and someone tampered with the numbers (say raised them to a
larger amount then their quote), thus getting that contract
(because they appear to have the cheaper price). The other aspect
is encryption of sensitive messages, you would not write down the
results of a medical exam and send it to someone on a postcard,
nor should you send it via unencrypted email. Even if no
malicious attacker reads it when it is sent, chances are that
message will be stored in a back-up of server data, and at some
point in the future someone could read it. If the message were
encrypted however this would be much more difficult.</p>
<p>With Windows you have two main choices for signing and
encrypting email with the standard mailers (Netscape, Outlook,
Outlook Express, Eudora, etc.). The first is an X.509 digital
certificate, and the second is PGP (or GnuPG in the future) and
there is a web based encrypted email service available. </p>
<h5>X.509 Certificates</h5>
<p>X.509 digital certificates are extremely easy to use, and most
mail clients have built in support, so there is no need to get a
software package such as PGP and install it at both ends. X.509
certificates from Verisign cost $14.95 US a year, and must be
renewed on a yearly basis. If you are in a sufficiently large
company, and you are primarily concerned about intra-company
email, you can also buy Certificate Authority software and issue
certificates to your own employees (the initial cost is quite
high, and maintenance is expensive, however it can be more
economical and easier to control then relying on a third party
such as Verisign). </p>
<p>The certificate can be stored on the client machines, however
this is a really bad idea (it's so bad in fact I decided to put
this at the very beginning of the explanation). You can easily
generate an X.509 certificate, take the file and load it into a
client machine (typically the mail program or www program can
make use of it). This however makes the assumption that only one
person will be using the workstation, and that the machine cannot
be misused by others. This is really only useful on a home PC
(that is secure), or if you lock your office door and never let
anyone in and have a secured PC. In a business environment the
certificates could be useful as identification of the machine
(but not as identification of the user), in Internet Explorer for
example you can mark the private key non-exportable, meaning to
copy the certificate off the client workstation and put it on
another will slow down most attackers. In other words digital
certificates loaded onto client machines are useless, in fact
they can be worse then useless because they are usually not
protected sufficiently (i.e. with a passphrase) so an attacker
can steal the certificate and impersonate the user. The better
solution is to store the X.509 certificate on a smartcard, this
allows a much more secure method of generating and storing
certificates, as well as being far more portable. The main
problem currently with smartcards is the lack of smartcard
readers on computers (although some companies like Siemens ship
them as a relatively standard option) and the cost of a good
smartcard and reader ($100.00 USD is not out of question). There
are also a wide variety of smartcards, ranging from ones that
simply store data (and are not secure) to ones with built in
random number generators, encryption chips, storage, and have
been built to be tamper resistant (these cards cost $25 USD each
typically). An additional benefit of these cards is you can use
them for logging in to a wide variety of services (Windows 2000
has smartcard support for logins), and are quite easy to use.</p>
<p>To get a certificate simply go to <a href="appendix-a.html#Thawte-Personal-Certificate">Thawte</a> or <a href="appendix-a.html#VeriSign-Digital-ID">Verisign</a> (please
note Verisign just purchases Thawte), and follow the instructions
online. The process is rather simple, you prove your identity to
them (via name, birthday, SIN number, etc.), pay for the
certificate (via credit card, online), and then you generate the
certificate locally (a private and public key pair), and then
send the public key to them. They take the public key, add your
information (name, email address and so on), and then sign it
with their private key. In this way anyone with a common mail
client can verify your key is legitimate, since most mail clients
will have Verisign's and Thawte's public keys built into them. If
you want real security I would advise buying a smartcard and
smartcard reader. Currently Thawte is running a promotion with <a href="appendix-a.html#Datakey-Smart-Card-Security-Kit">Datakey</a>,
you can purchase a Datakey smartcard, card reader, software, and
Thawte personal certificate for $89.95 (USD). This may seem
expensive but consider that the certificate is generated on the
card, stored on the card, and cannot leave the card, in addition
to this you need a password to access it, making it as secure as
you can get without spending a ridiculous amount of money. I
would recommend this kit, I actually own one and use it to sign
all my email, it is very easy and convenient to use, as well as
being portable, in a secure fashion.</p>
<h5>PGP</h5>
<p>Pretty Good Privacy was one of the original programs that made
email encryption possible, however it was difficult to use, had
to be installed by the user (unlike email clients shipping with
X.509 support), and was generally a pain to use. This has changed
in recent years, with the current version of PGP at 6.5.2,
integrating it with most mailers (Outlook, Netscape and Eudora
notably) is a painless task, even for novice users. PGP is
available for free for non-commercial usage, and there are two
commercial versions available from Network Associates (who also
distribute the free version). Commercial PGP was historically
only available in the US and Canada, however it was recently
granted an export license which should help it's acceptance in
other countries. The free version of PGP comes in two flavors,
one with and one without <a href="appendix-e.html">patented RSA</a>
components. If you are within the US or Canada you can use the
free version of PGP <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Freeware">from
here</a>. If you are outside the US or Canada you can get the <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Freeware">International version of PGP
here</a>, or potentially buy a commercial copy soon of either <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Personal-Privacy">PGP Personal privacy</a>
or <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Desktop-Security">PGP Desktop
Security</a> (has some extra bells and whistles). Once you have
downloaded the software simply double click on it to install, you
will be lead through a rather normal Windows software install,
however when you get to the components choice box you should
uncheck anything you do not plan to use, especially support for
mailers you do not have since PGP will be unable to find them,
and the install will complain. Also if you do not need the VPN
client, do no install it, it has a tendency to cause networking
issues (small glitch like problems). The install will prompt you
to either import an existing keyring (which if you are new to PGP
you will not have), or create a new set of keys. I would advise
using a 1024 or 2048 bit keylength for &quot;daily&quot; use,
4096 bit keys are slow to use and realistically if an attacker
can factor a 2048 bit key in a reasonable amount of time they
have probably found some flaw in PGP. You should send your keys
to the keyserver when prompted to do so, as it will make it
possible for other people to get your keys without having to go
to you (so for example if I receive email from you, and I see it
is PGP signed, I can retrieve your key from a keyserver and
verify the signature, and in turn encrypt my reply to you).</p>
<p>If you want to find someone else's key either right click on
the PGP tray icon and choose &quot;PGPKeys&quot; or go to the
Windows Start menu and select &quot;PGPKeys&quot;. Once in
PGPKeys you select &quot;Server&quot;, &quot;Search&quot;, select
a keyserver (ldap://certserver.pgp.com is a default so many
people use it), and enter the email address you are searching
for, it should be in the User ID of their key (since email
addresses area relatively unique identifier). You will be present
with a list of keys matching your criteria, simply right click on
the key you wish to have, and choose &quot;Import&quot;, and that
is it. When you use this key to verify digitally signed email
from the person the mail software will complain about it being an
untrusted key, by default foreign keys are untrusted unless they
are signed by someone you trust (such as a friend, or yourself).
To get rid of this (i.e. I and my boss exchange a lot of
encrypted email), sign their key with a non exportable signature,
in &quot;PGPKeys&quot; simple right click on the key, choose
&quot;Sign&quot;, do NOT check the box saying &quot;Allow
signature to be exported. Others may rely upon your
signature&quot;, and then choose the key to sign it with, and
enter your password. You should never sign a key with an
exportable signature unless you have met face to face with the
person, proven your ID to each other, and then signed your keys. </p>
<p>When signing and decrypting email you will be prompted for
your password, which can be annoying, PGP can cache the password,
however be careful. If you enter your password and then leave
your email client running and leave the computer unattended
someone could use it and send email from you that is digitally
signed (thus impersonating you). If you turn on the password
saving feature you should be careful to always shutdown your mail
client when you leave the computer unattended. To set the cache
time simply go to the PGP settings (in Outlook it is
&quot;Tools&quot;, &quot;PGP&quot;, &quot;Options&quot;, then the
&quot;General&quot; tab), and simply set the cache time to an
appropriate length. If you want to be safe do not cache the
signing passphrase, this way you can read email encrypted with
your private key and not have to enter the password for your
private key constantly, but you will be prompted for your
password when you try to send signed email. </p>
<h5>GnuPG</h5>
<p>GnuPG for Windows is planned however not yet available (well
it is, but it's not terribly user friendly yet).</p>
<h5>Hushmail</h5>
<p><a href="appendix-a.html#Hushmail">Hushmail</a> is a new
contender in the web based email wars. It however offers
something that none of the other web based email sites offer, and
that is signed and encrypted email to other Hushmail users.
Hushmail uses a java applet that is downloaded to your PC with
your keypair, when you send and receive email within Hushmail it
is signed and encrypted, providing for a high degree of security
despite it's web based nature. Hushmail is a free and easy
solution to use, and has the added advantage of being much more
portable then X.509 certificates or PGP (you don't even need a
mail client, you only need a Java and SSL capable web browser).
The primary problem with Hushmail is proving your identity, as
far as I know Hushmail does not check the users identity, so
unless you establish the persons identity through some other
channel like a face to face meeting where you verify each other's
key fingerprints, you could be dealing with anyone (this problem
is endemic however, as impersonating someone to get an X.509
certificate in their name is not impossible). The Hushmail Java
applet source code is also available, so you can compile it and
verify that this is indeed the binary that Hushmail is using (so
you can inspect the code for problems, etc.). </p>
