<p>Anything you do or say on the Internet (or even a corporate
LAN or university LAN) can end up as front page news. Nowadays
with everyone's computer connected to a multitude of other
computers (and usually to the Internet as well) the chances of
someone else being able to monitor and / or copy the information
you interact with are quite high. In addition to this many
corporations and other organizations have policies that result in
email, and other forms of network traffic being logged, and
sometimes the actual content stored. A good example of this is
the embarrassing email that Microsoft sent internally that was
later used during the trial against them. Also without
cryptography anyone can easily impersonate you, how do you think
co-workers (or your mom) would react if they received an email
from you that was asking for the location of child pornography
sites. Even if it was later proven that you had not sent it you
would still have suffered because of it. </p>
<p>Even more scary then this is the potential for data stored on
your personal computer to be exposed to a court of law. In
February of 2000 Northwest Airlines succesfully got a warrant to
search the home computers of employees for evidence of a planned
&quot;sick-out&quot; (a type of strike). These are machines that
are the personal property of people and not corporate machines.
If this trend continues then anyone that works for a company may
have their personal privacy invaded when a court ordered search
takes place and data is taken into evidence. Cryptography,
properly installed and used would render the information stored
completely inaccesible. </p>
<p>Cryptography allows you to communicate securely with other
parties. This not only includes the ability to encrypt a message
so that only the person the data is meant for can read it, but
also the ability to prove you sent a message, and that the
message wasn't tampered with and so on. The Internet, and the
services it offers (especially Email) have become ubiquitous.
Sensitive information is routinely sent via email, with little or
no protection used to verify who sent it, that it wasn't modified
while in transit, or that only the recipient can actually read
it. Historically cryptography has been very difficult for end
users, with little or no integration into existing programs and
operating systems, fortunately this has changed in the last few
years, and now anyone can easily get, install, configure and use
strong cryptographic software.</p>
<p>Another area where cryptography shines is in providing an
additional, strong layer of security to networks. Most current
services on the Internet send data in unprotected forms (called
&quot;clear text&quot; hyperlink to glossary), that anyone can
read. Many network services (such as email) require a username
and password to access, an attacker can easily pick that data off
of the network and then use it (to access your email, impersonate
you, or for other actions). By encrypting your network data
(using a Virtual Private Network, such as IPSec hyperlink to
glossary) you can virtually eliminate this threat. As
corporations allow wider access to their networks (for example
home users with ADSL or cablemodems), protecting the data moving
across public networks becomes a serious issue. Again
historically this type of protection was ridiculously expensive,
or simply unobtainable, however in the last few years there has
been an explosion of software to make this possible.</p>
<p>Consider every single email message you have ever sent or
received falling in to the hands of your competitor.</p>
