<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Email is the killer application that made the Internet grow at
first (the second killer application would probably be the web
which makes sharing information on a one to many basis easy).
Currently several billion messages a day are passed over the
Internet. It is no longer uncommon to get 20 or even 200 emails a
day for some people, a number that would have been quite amazing
a few years ago. The percentage of email that is actually
readable by an attacker, or that can be manipulated while in
transit with little chance of discover is close to 100%. </p>
<p>There are two main issues with email encryption, this first is
digitally signing email, the second is encrypting email. With
digital signatures on an email you can prove the sender identity,
and that the message was not tampered with while in transit.
Imagine if you were to send a price quote via email to someone,
and someone tampered with the numbers (say raised them to a
larger amount then their quote), thus getting that contract
(because they appear to have the cheaper price). The other aspect
is encryption of sensitive messages, you would not write down the
results of a medical exam and send it to someone on a postcard,
nor should you send it via unencrypted email. Even if no
malicious attacker reads it when it is sent, chances are that
message will be stored in a back-up of server data, and at some
point in the future someone could read it. If the message were
encrypted however this would be much more difficult.</p>
<p>With UNIX you have two main choices for signing and encrypting
email. The first is an X.509 digital certificate (which work well
in Netscape and a few other mailers), and the second is PGP or
GnuPG (which work well with the text based mailers like pine),
and there is a web based encrypted mail service available.</p>
<h5>X.509 Certificates</h5>
<p>X.509 digital certificates are extremely easy to use, and most
mail clients have built in support, so there is no need to get a
software package such as PGP and install it at both ends. X.509
certificates from Verisign cost $14.95 US a year, and must be
renewed on a yearly basis. If you are in a sufficiently large
company, and you are primarily concerned about intra-company
email, you can also buy Certificate Authority software and issue
certificates to your own employees (the initial cost is quite
high, and maintenance is expensive, however it can be more
economical and easier to control then relying on a third party
such as Verisign). </p>
<p>The certificate can be stored on the client machines, however
this is a really bad idea (it's so bad in fact I decided to put
this at the very beginning of the explanation). You can easily
generate an X.509 certificate, take the file and load it into a
client machine (typically the mail program or www program can
make use of it). This however makes the assumption that only one
person will be using the workstation, and that the machine cannot
be misused by others. This is really only useful on a home PC
(that is secure), or if you lock your office door and never let
anyone in and have a secured PC. In other words digital
certificates loaded onto client machines are almost useless, in
fact they can be worse then useless because they are usually not
protected sufficiently (i.e. with a passphrase) so an attacker
can steal the certificate and impersonate the user. The better
solution is to store the X.509 certificate on a smartcard
(unfortunately most UNIX systems have poor smart card support in
this respect), this allows a much more secure method of
generating and storing certificates, as well as being far more
portable. The main problem currently with smartcards is the lack
of smartcard readers on computers (although some companies like
Siemens ship them as a relatively standard option) and the cost
of a good smartcard and reader ($100.00 USD is not out of
question). There are also a wide variety of smartcards, ranging
from ones that simply store data (and are not secure) to ones
with built in random number generators, encryption chips,
storage, and have been built to be tamper resistant (these cards
cost $25 USD each typically). </p>
<p>To get a certificate simply go to <a href="appendix-a.html#Thawte-Personal-Certificate">Thawte</a> or <a href="appendix-a.html#VeriSign-Digital-ID">Verisign</a> (please
note Verisign just purchases Thawte), and follow the instructions
online. The process is rather simple, you prove your identity to
them (via name, birthday, SIN number, etc.), pay for the
certificate (via credit card, online), and then you generate the
certificate locally (a private and public key pair), and then
send the public key to them. They take the public key, add your
information (name, email address and so on), and then sign it
with their private key. In this way anyone with a common mail
client can verify your key is legitimate, since most mail clients
will have Verisign's and Thawte's public keys built into them. If
you want real security I would advise buying a smartcard and
smartcard reader. </p>
<p>Netscape with X.509 certificates</p>
<p>In Netscape mail you administer certificates by going to
&quot;Communicator&quot;, &quot;Tools&quot;, &quot;Security
Info&quot;, &quot;Certificates&quot;, &quot;Yours&quot;. From
here you can get a certificate (you are directed to Netscape's
site where there is a link to Verisign which appears broken),
from <a href="appendix-a.html#VeriSign-Digital-ID">Verisign</a>
or <a href="appendix-a.html#Thawte-Personal-Certificate">Thawte</a>,
following the same procedure as usual, and you can also import an
existing certificate (for example if you had one in Windows but
moved over to Linux). </p>
<p>Outlook, Outlook Express with X.509 certificates</p>
<p>In Outlook you can administer certificates, and request new
ones. Simple go to &quot;Tools&quot;, &quot;Options&quot;,
&quot;Security&quot; and you can then choose &quot;Digital
IDs&quot;, from here you can import, export, and remove
certificates from Internet Explorer. You can also choose
&quot;Get Digital IDs&quot; which will take you to a Microsoft
webpage with links to the various certificate issuing
authorities. </p>
<h5>PGP</h5>
<p>Pretty Good Privacy was one of the original programs that made
email encryption possible, however it was difficult to use, had
to be installed by the user (unlike email clients shipping with
X.509 support), and was generally a pain to use. Unfortunately
this is still mostly true in the UNIX world. If you are going to
use PGP I would advise using GnuPG instead. GnuPG is 100%
compatible, and completely unencumbered by patents or licensing
issues. If you need to use PGP you can get <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Freeware">PGP Freeware</a> or <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-International">PGP International</a>.</p>
<h5>GnuPG</h5>
<p>GnuPG is a GPL'ed application that is fully compatible with
PGP. You can sign and encrypt data in GnuPG, verify and decrypt
it in PGP and vice versa. The other advantage is that GnuPG is
not export restricted (made in Germany) and uses no patented
algorithms making licensing issues non-existent. <a href="appendix-a.html#GnuPG">GnuPG</a> is available as source and
as binary packages for most popular unices. </p>
<h5>pgp4pine</h5>
<p>pgp4pine uses pine's built in filter functionality to provide
encryption, decryption, signing and verification of email.
pgp4pine also works with GnuPG, you can get <a href="appendix-a.html#pgp4pine">pgp4pine</a> as source code or
binary packages for a variety of systems.</p>
<h5>Hushmail</h5>
<p><a href="appendix-a.html#Hushmail">Hushmail</a> is a new
contender in the web based email wars. It however offers
something that none of the other web based email sites offer, and
that is signed and encrypted email to other Hushmail users.
Hushmail uses a java applet that is downloaded to your PC with
your keypair, when you send and receive email within Hushmail it
is signed and encrypted, providing for a high degree of security
despite it's web based nature. Hushmail is a free and easy
solution to use, and has the added advantage of being much more
portable then X.509 certificates or PGP (you don't even need a
mail client, you only need a Java and SSL capable web browser).
The primary problem with Hushmail is proving your identity, as
far as I know Hushmail does not check the users identity, so
unless you establish the persons identity through some other
channel like a face to face meeting where you verify each other's
key fingerprints, you could be dealing with anyone (this problem
is endemic however, as impersonating someone to get an X.509
certificate in their name is not impossible). The Hushmail Java
applet source code is also available, so you can compile it and
verify that this is indeed the binary that Hushmail is using (so
you can inspect the code for problems, etc.). </p>
