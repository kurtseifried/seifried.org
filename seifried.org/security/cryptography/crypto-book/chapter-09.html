<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Do you have files on your computer that you wouldn't want your
spouse to read, or perhaps your main competitor. Chances are if
you use your computer for work or general usage the answer is
yes. Also what happens if you want to send a file to someone, or
let them download it from you, but you only have access to a
public site (like a free web hosting company). The answer is to
encrypt the file, and fire it off. For Windows you have several
choices, PGP, and GnuPG, as well as Guardbot for web based file
transfers. If you work with files that are sensitive (such as
spreadsheets containing sensitive financial data) the constant
hassle of encrypting and decrypting the file (as well as the fact
a decrypted copy will be stored on the filesystem, leaving a
window of opportunity for an attacker) can get tedious. If this
is the case you will want to use software such as EFS (available
in Windows 2000), PGPdisk or BestCrypt to create an encrypted
file which you can use like a drive. The advantage of this is you
only authenticate once to access say the &quot;X:&quot; drive,
and there is a lesser chance the the file will be stored in an
unencrypted format on the disk (it might be placed in the swap
file). This allows you to easily keep a set of files encrypted,
but easily accessible to work on. </p>
<h5>PGP</h5>
<p>Pretty Good Privacy used to be command line driven with no
GUI, and now the command line is an install time option (in other
words PGP integrates itself quite well with windows and you
generally won't need the command line to use it). PGP is
available for free for non-commercial usage, and there are two
commercial versions available from Network Associates (who also
distribute the free version). Commercial PGP was historically
only available in the US and Canada, however it was recently
granted an export license which should help it's acceptance in
other countries. The free version of PGP comes in two flavors,
one with and one without <a href="appendix-e.html">patented RSA</a>
components. If you are within the US or Canada you can use the
free version of PGP <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Freeware">from
here</a>. If you are outside the US or Canada you can get the <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Freeware">International version of PGP
here</a>, or potentially buy a commercial copy soon of either <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Personal-Privacy">PGP Personal privacy</a>
or <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Desktop-Security">PGP Desktop
Security</a> (has some extra bells and whistles). Once you have
downloaded the software simply double click on it to install, you
will be lead through a rather normal Windows software install,
however when you get to the components choice box you should
uncheck anything you do not plan to use, especially support for
mailers you do not have since PGP will be unable to find them,
and the install will complain. Also if you do not need the VPN
client, do no install it, it has a tendency to cause networking
issues (small glitch like problems). The install will prompt you
to either import an existing keyring (which if you are new to PGP
you will not have), or create a new set of keys. I would advise
using a 1024 or 2048 bit keylength for &quot;daily&quot; use,
4096 bit keys are slow to use and realistically if an attacker
can factor a 2048 bit key in a reasonable amount of time they
have probably found some flaw in PGP. On the other hand if you
are storing sensitive files, or transmitting them often, and have
a long time horizon in which you need to keep the data secret, a
larger key is appropriate. You should send your keys to the
keyserver when prompted to do so, as it will make it possible for
other people to get your keys without having to go to you (so for
example if I receive email from you, and I see it is PGP signed,
I can retrieve your key from a keyserver and verify the
signature, and in turn encrypt my reply to you).</p>
<p>If you want to find someone else's key either right click on
the PGP tray icon and choose &quot;PGPKeys&quot; or go to the
Windows Start menu and select &quot;PGPKeys&quot;. Once in
PGPKeys you select &quot;Server&quot;, &quot;Search&quot;, select
a keyserver (ldap://certserver.pgp.com is a default so many
people use it), and enter the email address you are searching
for, it should be in the User ID of their key (since email
addresses area relatively unique identifier). You will be present
with a list of keys matching your criteria, simply right click on
the key you wish to have, and choose &quot;Import&quot;, and that
is it. When you use this key to verify digitally signed files
from the person the PGP software might complain about it being an
untrusted key, by default foreign keys are untrusted unless they
are signed by someone you trust (such as a friend, or yourself).
To get rid of this (i.e. I and my boss exchange a lot of
encrypted files), sign their key with a non exportable signature,
in &quot;PGPKeys&quot; simple right click on the key, choose
&quot;Sign&quot;, do NOT check the box saying &quot;Allow
signature to be exported. Others may rely upon your
signature&quot;, and then choose the key to sign it with, and
enter your password. You should never sign a key with an
exportable signature unless you have met face to face with the
person, proven your ID to each other, and then signed your keys. </p>
<p>When signing and decrypting files you will be prompted for
your password, which can be annoying, PGP can cache the password,
however be careful. If you enter your password and then leave
your email client running and leave the computer unattended
someone could use it and send email from you that is digitally
signed (thus impersonating you). If you turn on the password
saving feature you should be careful to always shutdown your mail
client when you leave the computer unattended. To set the cache
time simply go to the PGP settings (in Outlook it is
&quot;Tools&quot;, &quot;PGP&quot;, &quot;Options&quot;, then the
&quot;General&quot; tab), and simply set the cache time to an
appropriate length. If you want to be safe do not cache the
signing passphrase, this way you can decrypt encrypted files with
your private key and not have to enter the password for your
private key constantly, but you will be prompted for your
password when you try to sign a file. </p>
<p>To encrypt or decrypt files simply right click on them in
Windows (on the desktop, or in the file explorer), and choose
&quot;PGP&quot; followed by &quot;Encrypt&quot;, &quot;Decrypt
and Verify&quot;, or whichever option you want to use. One use of
this is to sign files, this creates a file with the signature
(i.e. filename.asc), copy it to a safe location, and you can use
it later to check if the file was modified (say you have a
spreadsheet with a lot of data and are paranoid about someone
changing it). </p>
<p>A better long term solution is to use PGPdisk, which allows
you to create an encrypted drive (actually it is a file that is
mounted so you can easily access it). PGPdisk only comes with the
commercial versions of PGP, which means you need to buy either <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Personal-Privacy">PGP Personal privacy</a>
or <a href="appendix-a.html#PGP-Desktop-Security">PGP Desktop
Security</a>. During the install make sure &quot;PGPdisk for
Windows&quot; is selected, once you reboot simply go to the Start
menu, PGP, and select PGPdisk, you will be presented with
&quot;New&quot;, &quot;Mount&quot;, &quot;Unmount&quot; and
&quot;Prefs&quot;. To create a new encrypted volume simply click
&quot;New&quot;, you will be prompted for a filename and location
(probably your &quot;C:&quot; drive), this file actually contains
the encrypted data, but Windows can mount it, like a floppy disk,
so that you access it by simply going to the drive letter you
assign (like &quot;X:&quot;), hit save and you will be prompted
for the file size to create, and the drive letter to assign to it
(such as &quot;X:&quot;), after this you will be prompted for the
passphrase to protect it, and once this is done it will ask for
some random data (since Windows doesn't have a good random number
generating facility programs usually ask for random keyboard or
mouse input). It then brings up the format screen (and since
Windows thinks it is a harddrive it asks if you really want to do
this), and once the format is complete it mounts the drive and
you can use it. The one thing I don't like about PGPdisk (at
least version 6.0.2), is that there is no option to automatically
mount the drive at boot time (which would prompt you for the
passphrase of course, but it would be nice to automate it
somewhat). The Mount and Unmount buttons allow you to mount and
un-mount existing encrypted files as drives, and aren't terribly
interesting. The Prefs button on the other hand has some neat
features, you can specify an inactivity timeout, so if you don't
use the encrypted volume for say 10 minutes it un-mounts it, and
you can also specify a hot key to do this (should the FBI burst
in suddenly), and you can have it un-mount the volume when the
computer &quot;sleeps&quot; (halfway powers down). I would advise
using all these if you are concerned about the safety of your
data, especially in an office environment.</p>
<h5>GnuPG</h5>
<p>GnuPG for Windows is planned however not yet available (well
it is, but it's not terribly user friendly yet).</p>
<h5>BestCrypt</h5>
<p><a href="appendix-a.html#BestCrypt">BestCrypt</a> is a disk
encrypting program similar to PGPdisk. It allows you to create a
fake drive, say &quot;X:&quot; that is actually an encrypted
file, mounted as a filesystem to ease access. BestCrypt has
several significant advantages over PGP and EFS however, it is
available for Windows and Linux, and the source code is
available! This will allow you to dual boot a machine between
Windows and Linux, and share an encrypted filesystem for example,
something you cannot do with any other products. The other huge
advantage over PGP and EFS is you can validate the source code
(this is of interest for companies that plan to roll out a few
thousand copies and want to make sure it does what it claims to).
To add insult to injury there are several version of BestCrypt
that are free, for DOS, Windows 3.x and Linux (nice of them).
BestCrypt is easy to use, simply download it, double click to
install, you might need to reboot (once I had to, once I did not,
strange). Simply start up the BestCrypt control panel, choose the
drive you want the data to reside on (probably &quot;C:&quot;),
then choose &quot;Container&quot; and &quot;New&quot;, a good
filename is like &quot;my-encrypted-stuff&quot; (realistically an
attacker will find it, and since it's encrypted this isn't a huge
concern). You will be able to choose the algorithm you want, I
would recommend Blowfish over DES (a 56 bit algorithm) and GOST
(BestCrypt's own algorithm, which isn't as well tested as
Blowfish or DES). You then choose a size, and set a passphrase to
access the container, at this point the container is created and
you can now mount the container (right click on the container),
choose mount, a drive letter (like &quot;X:&quot;) and the option
to mount at logon (makes sense if you plan to use it often). The
first time you try to mount a container it will complain that it
is not formatted, you can at this point format it. One feature
BestCrypt has that PGPdisk lacks is the ability to automatically
mount the encrypted volume(s) when you login (and prompts your
for your password of course), so you don't have to keep mounting
them manually each time you reboot. Like PGPdisk BestCrypt has
options to specify an inactivity timeout, simple go to the
BestCrypt control panel, &quot;Options&quot; and then
&quot;Timeout&quot;.</p>
<h5>Scramdisk</h5>
<p><a href="appendix-a.html#Scramdisk">Scramdisk</a> is a free,
OpenSource disk encryption program for Windows, written by an
anonymous programmer (although (s)he cklaims to be from Britain).
The source code is available online, as well as binary packages.
Scramdisk supports a variety of algorithms, 3DES, Blowfish and
IDEA notably. The install is rather simple, uncompress the
program and the VXD (virtual device driver that allows you to
mount a file as a filesystem, just as PGP and BestCrypt do), copy
the VXD to the appropriate location (double click the install and
it will error out the first time, and tell you where to put the
VXD). Then run the install and reboot. The obvious advantage of
this product is that it is completely free, and OpenSource, so if
you have the resources you can ensure it meets your safety
requirements.</p>
<h5>EFS</h5>
<p>It would appear that Microsoft is starting to take security
seriously in Windows 2000. Unfortunately with their past track
record and general implementation strategies the new Encrypting
File System (EFS) appears to have some severe limitations and
flaws. Because Microsoft is an American company they come under
US cryptographic export law, meaning the US / Canadian version of
EFS uses strong crypto, but the foreign versions use weak crypto
(and I haven't heard of MS applying for an export license).
Additionally EFS is an integral part of the filesystem, meaning
you cannot simply copy a container file (like PGP or BestCrypt
use) to another machine, and is somewhat more difficult to backup
properly. EFS is also closed source, so you don't know if
Microsoft has made a mistake (like they did in PPTP, LanMAN
hashes, password storage in NT 4, etc.). Another MAJOR problem
with EFS is that the administrator can set it so that your data
can be retrieved without your permission. This is ostensibly so
that if you die your files can retrieved, however if you do not
control your workstation, chances are (especially in today's
business environment where users are heavily monitored) that EFS
is configured so files can be retrieved. The only good thing
about EFS is the ease of use, and that it is free (it ships with
the system). Simply right click on the file or folder you wish to
encrypt, you can also create encrypted drives. Unlike PGP or
BestCrypt individually encrypted files and folders can be
accessed transparently by programs with no need to constantly
encrypt and decrypt files. I would only use EFS as a last resort
if nothing else is available (or if I wanted to be able to easily
decrypt the data if I forget my password, which defeats the
primary purpose). <a href="appendix-a.html#EFS">EFS</a> can also
be used from the command line with the command
&quot;cipher&quot;. EFS is also only available on NTFS drives,
but if you are at all security conscious you will be using NTFS
and <strong>NOT</strong> FAT or FAT32.</p>
<h5>Guardbot</h5>
<p>Another new possibility is <a href="appendix-a.html#Guardbot">Guardbot</a>,
which password protects www pages. Essentially there are two
components, an applet that encrypts the data, using DES (56 bit
keyspace), and an applet that will decrypt the data with the
password you provide. The advantage of this over traditional
server based methods of control (such as htaccess in Apache) is
that the user manages it fully, and can protect each file
individually without much setup. To fully take advantage of the
keyspace available your password must contain upper and lower
case letters, numbers (and punctuation marks, but this can
confuse users) of around 10 letters, however since people tend to
choose less then random passwords a longer password then this is
advisable. This program would be useful for getting files to
other people cheaply (simply sign up for some free web space,
post the file up, and get the password to the other person
securely).</p>
