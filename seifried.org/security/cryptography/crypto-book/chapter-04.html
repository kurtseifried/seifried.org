<p>Encryption is primarily composed of public / private key
systems in the modern world. The main problems with any system to
distribute public keys are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>How do you know this is in fact the right key for the
party you wish to communicate with</li>
<li>How do you know the information associated with the key
is correct (i.e. name, email address, etc.)</li>
<li>How do you know the key has not been revoked (i.e. if it
is stolen the owner would want people to stop using it)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you cannot meet every single person you wish to
communicate with and verify all the details there is a need for a
solution. Public Key Infrastructure allows for distribution (and
to some degree management) of public keys, thus allowing people
to encrypt/decrypt, sign and verify data from other people.
Typically you have trusted 3rd parties (such as Verisign) that
have a set of keys that are preinstalled in software (such as web
browsers and email clients. Using these keys the third party
supposedly checks up on the identity of organizations or people
and then signs their public keys, you can verify that signature
since the keys required to do so are built into your software
(and if you cannot trust your software you've got bigger
problems). These 3rd parties also typically run servers that
maintain copies of the keys so you can search them, for say
&quot;John Parker&quot; entries, and also allow the owner of the
key to issue a &quot;revocation&quot; (meaning the key is no
longer valid). In a nutshell if Alice trusts Bob, Bob can then
verify the identities of Charles and David, Alice can then verify
that Charles and David's keys have been okayed by Bob, and use
them with a relative degree of safety. Of course the real world
is far from perfect. Obtaining encryption keys signed by another
party is easy, you can either steal them (most people run Windows
and have little or no security enabled), or steal someone's
identity and use their personal information to create and
register keys without their knowledge (and as digital signature
laws come into being this will be a serious problem as the
rewards for fraud grow). An excellent paper on these and more
problems is available:</p>
