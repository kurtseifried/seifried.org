<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Do you have files on your computer that you wouldn't want your
spouse to read, or perhaps your main competitor. Chances are if
you use your computer for work or general usage the answer is
yes. Also what happens if you want to send a file to someone, or
let them download it from you, but you only have access to a
public site (like a free web hosting company). The answer is to
encrypt the file, and fire it off. For UNIX you have several
choices, PGP, and GnuPG, as well as Guardbot for web based file
transfers. If you work with files that are sensitive (such as
spreadsheets containing sensitive financial data) the constant
hassle of encrypting and decrypting the file (as well as the fact
a decrypted copy will be stored on the filesystem, leaving a
window of opportunity for an attacker) can get tedious. If this
is the case you will want to use software such as, BestCrypt
(commercially licensed but free for Linux with source code), or
PPDD (Private and Top Secret, GPL licensed) which are both very
similar in execution and general usage.</p>
<h4>Encrypting files and drives</h4>
<h5>PGP</h5>
<p>Pretty Good Privacy is available as a command line driven
program for most UNIX platforms, and there are a variety of front
end GUI programs for it. I would not recommend using PGP on a
UNIX platform since a completely OpenSource, and compatible
replacement is now available, in the form of GnuPG.</p>
<h5>GnuPG</h5>
<p>GnuPG is a GPL licensed (a.k.a. completely free in every
respect), written in Germany (a very pro-crypto and pro-privacy
country). Since it is available in full source code chances are
it has been ported to your UNIX platform (and if not try
compiling it, it might work). You can download <a href="appendix-a.html#GnuPG">GnuPG</a> as a compressed tarball of
source code, and there are links to a number of source and binary
packages for various UNIX platforms. Once installed GnuPG behaves
very similarly to PGP. The first thing you'll probably want to do
is generate a new keypair, simply use the command &quot;gpg
--gen-key&quot;, it will create a &quot;.gnupg&quot; directory in
which to store your keys, option files and so on and exit, you
then run it again and it will lead you through the key creation
process. Choosing the defaults during key generation is a pretty
safe bet, although you may want to use a 2048 bit keysize
(realistically if someone manages to crack 1024 bit keys, chances
are they can get at your 2048 bit key, however if they are only
trying to brute force it a longer key is a good way to reduce the
chances of that). For personal keys the expiry is typically set
to &quot;0&quot; (that is to say they do not expire), however if
these keys are for corporate use, or for really sensitive
information it is a good idea to expire keys and rotate them
(every month, year, decade, whatever your security policy
dictates). The most important thing when generating a key (in my
opinion) is the passphrase. This is a string of characters which
should consist of letters (upper and lower case) numbers and
punctuation marks, the longer the better (I'd say the bare
minimum is 10 characters). This controls access to the private
key, which is used to sign items (and if compromised means an
attacker could easily impersonate you), and to decrypt data
(meaning an attacker could access all your data). Keep your
private key secure! If an attacker gains access to this key they
only have to brute force the passphrase, which is typically a lot
weaker then a random 1024 bit (or longer) key. Worse yet they may
steal your passphrase, with a keyboard sniffer or similar attack,
resulting in a compromise of your key. If the attacker does not
have access to your private key they will be forced to guess it,
which takes a brutally long time (on average however, there is a
chance they may guess the key correctly on their first try). </p>
<p>Signing files is useful if you want to distribute a file to
someone, and be able to prove that you sent it, and it was not
tampered with. Internally GnuPG takes a hash sum (such as MD5 or
SHA1) of the file (basically it reduces the file to a shorter,
unique string of data) which it then encrypts with your private
key, generating a signature. This signature can then be decrypted
with your public key, resulting in possession of the hash sum of
the file, simply take the hash sum of the file in question, and
if the they match, then obviously the file is what it claims to
be. This signature file can be a binary file, or converted into
text (for example signing email, or distributing file signatures
via email). To sign a file with gpg simply use :</p>
<pre>$ gpg -b file</pre>
<p>which will create a detached signature of the file.</p>
<p>To verify the signature use &quot;gpg --verify file.sig
file&quot;. If all is well you should see something like:</p>
<pre>$ gpg --verify file.sig file
gpg: Signature made Sat 15 Jan 2000 05:23:31 AM MST using DSA key ID 47D0D9A8

</pre>
<p>If someone has fiddled with the file or signature you will see
something like:</p>
<pre>$ gpg --verify file.sig file
gpg: Signature made Sat 15 Jan 2000 05:23:31 AM MST using DSA key ID 47D0D9A8

</pre>
<p>Encrypting files is also relatively simple, a person uses your
public key to run the data through a one way algorithm which
results in a seemingly random mishmash of data, you can then use
your private key to recover what the original data was, thus
decrypting it. To encrypt a file to someone you first need their
public key, you can download it from their homepage (if they have
it online of course), or you can go to a public key server, of
which there are many:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keyserver.net/">http://www.keyserver.net/</a>
- OpenPGP key server</p>
<p>Once you have their key it is simply a matter of signing and
encrypting the file (just encrypting the file is rare as there is
no proof of who the data is from, unless you use some other
method, like physically handing them a floppy disk with the
encrypted file). The following is an example of me signing a file
and encrypting it with my public key:</p>
<pre>$ gpg -s -e file

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
1024-bit DSA key, ID 47D0D9A8, created 2000-01-15

You did not specify a user ID. (you may use &quot;-r&quot;)


</pre>
<h5>Guardbot</h5>
<p>Another new possibility is <a href="appendix-a.html#Guardbot">Guardbot</a>,
which password protects www pages. Essentially there are two
components, an applet that encrypts the data, using DES (56 bit
keyspace), and an applet that will decrypt the data with the
password you provide. The advantage of this over traditional
server based methods of control (such as htaccess in Apache) is
that the user manages it fully, and can protect each file
individually without much setup. To fully take advantage of the
keyspace available your password must contain upper and lower
case letters, numbers (and punctuation marks, but this can
confuse users) of around 10 letters, however since people tend to
choose less then random passwords a longer password then this is
advisable. This program would be useful for getting files to
other people cheaply (simply sign up for some free web space,
post the file up, and get the password to the other person
securely).</p>
<h4>Hiding files and data on your computer</h4>
<p>It is no longer enough in some countries to encrypt your data
to prevent access to it. Recently in Britain a law was created
making it a criminal offence to refuse to give up encryption keys
or plain text versions of encrypted data. </p>
<h5>StegHide</h5>
<p>StegHide hides data in files such as sound and picture files
where not all of the bits in a byte are used. Since the data is
encrypted it will appear random, and proving that the data is
actually there is difficult. The only downside is to store a one
megabyte file you need a sound/picture file of several megabytes,
which can be cumbersome (but hard drives and high speed access
are becoming cheap so it's a moot point). You can get StegHide
at: <a href="http://www.stego.com/">http://www.stego.com/</a>.</p>
<h5>StegFS</h5>
<p>Steganographic File System actually hides data on your
harddrive, making it difficult to prove that it even exists. This
can be very useful as the attacker first has to find the data,
let alone break the strong encryption used to protect it. You can
get StegFS from: <a href="http://ban.joh.cam.ac.uk/~adm36/StegFS/">http://ban.joh.cam.ac.uk/~adm36/StegFS/</a>.</p>
<h5>OutGuess</h5>
<p>OutGuess hides data in image files, meaning you can send files
in a way that won't attract to much attention (and can't really
be prooved either). You can get it from: <a href="http://www.outguess.org/">http://www.outguess.org/</a>.</p>
