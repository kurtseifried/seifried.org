<p>January 26, 2000 - Modern computer security requires some
level of encryption to be applied to various kinds of data, for
example secure web transactions, or SSH. But something that often
goes ignored is the fact that all good crypto relies on some
degree of randomness, which if not fulfilled properly can lead to
a significant loss in the strength of encryption. </p>
<p>Most encryption algorithms require a source of random data,
even some symmetric ciphers (where the secret is shared), either
to generate new private/public keypairs, for session keys, for
padding, or for other reasons. Most computers do not have a
hardware based random number generator (RNG) available, so
programmers have had to resort to software based techniques, to
generate random numbers as best they can. Because these random
numbers are generated in software, they are very rarely truly
random, they are typically pseudo random (that is they appear
random, but are not totally random). To generate random data you
need a source of entropy, or random input. Some software RNG's
will ask you to move the mouse, or type on the keyboard as a
source of that entropy, others will take events such as hard
drive activity, or network activity for their source of entropy.
This typically works quite well for end user workstations (for
example generating keypairs in PGP for Windows, or /dev/random in
UNIX), but can be a problem in some cases, such as diskless
network appliances with a network card, some flash ram, and a
CPU. A network appliance that performs encryption (increasingly
popular as VPN's grow) has no good sources of entropy, apart from
network based events, which an attacker could manipulate to their
advantage. Hardware RNG's produce truly random data (well close
enough that analysis can't prove it otherwise), and software
RNG's do not.</p>
<p>So why is this important? Well your 168 bit 3DES encryption of
network packets might not be working as advertised if the random
data it uses to perform the encryption isn't truly random. If you
are moving sensitive corporate data over the VPN, a good hardware
based RNG is worth the money as compared to your R&amp;D plans
being snagged by a competitor. Additionally most software based
RNG's cannot create a lot of good data (most hardware based RNG's
as well have limits), so if the machine is carrying a heavy
crypto workload (say multiple tunnels, or many SSL based
connections for an e-commerce site) you might need to purchase
one of the higher end (and consequently more expensive) hardware
based RNG's. While expensive, a good hardware RNG can result in a
lower insurance rate for e-commerce sites and similar endeavors
(generally speaking the more money you spend making something
safer the likelier an insurance company is to insure it at a
reasonable rate). Please note however that while a hardware based
RNG will increase security, it can be rendered useless if there
are other flaws in the system (say storing credit card numbers in
a text file). Properly deployed a hardware RNG is a good security
enhancement.</p>
<p>So just how does a hardware RNG work? I'm glad you asked (or
this article would be too short to post). Generally speaking
there are a few things that generate random events that you can
measure and are truly random. One of the best sources of random
events is radioactive decay, however there are some major
problems with this, such as getting radioactive material, storing
it safely, and getting your boss to sign the PO. There are also
numerous laws regarding the purchase, transport, and so on of
radioactive material, so generally speaking unless you are a
government or major corporation this is out of reach. A good
alternative that is popular with some manufacturers (due to it's
minimal power requirements) is to measure the thermal noise of a
resistor. One example of this is Intel, whose 810 chipset (and
future 8xx chipset) has a built in hardware RNG, which can be
accessed via software such as RSA's BSAFE Crypto-C and Crypto-J
products (essentially RSA components for software like secure web
servers that use SSL). There are several problems with the Intel
hardware RNG, the primary one being that you must access the RNG
through a software component that Intel charges a licensing fee
for (I assume if you have to ask what it costs you are to poor to
pay for it), so chances are it will not be available for Linux,
*BSD and other OpenSource operating systems. A similar device is
the ComScire QNG hardware RNG, which uses the same technique
(measures thermal noise in a resistor) and connects to the
computer via a parallel port, it generates 10 to 20 kilobits per
second, which would be suitable for a medium sized secure web
server or similar. The main advantage of this product however is
the ease of use, plug it into the parallel port, install some
drivers and off you go (drivers are only available for DOS and NT
from the company, however there are independently written Linux
drivers available and they will give you the necessary technical
specifications to write drivers if you ask), so you can use it on
an existing system (for example as an upgrade to an existing
e-commerce server), this device is also relatively inexpensive,
at $295 USD. The next major family is based on an electrical
circuit consisting of several transistors or diodes that are
wired up in such a way that they generate random electrical
noise. This can then be fed straight into an serial port with a
good UART, or some additional hardware can translate it into a
string of bits and feed it to a serial or parallel port. The
advantage of these is they are ridiculously easy to design and
manufacture, using commodity parts (you can build your own with
minimal effort), and the simpler something is, the easier it is
to audit and protect. There are a variety of these on the market,
the SG100 being a good example, it produces a stream of noise
which is fed directly to the serial port, the UART converts it
into digital form and then software can make use of the
bitstream. This product is extremely cheap (at $140 USD), and
software examples are available (so it's the only hardware RNG
that will support UNIX easily I believe, the rest only seem to
support MS products).</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Most people don't need a hardware based random number
generator, but the need is growing. As e-commerce grows in
popularity and consumers start pounding on your site, chances are
the random data used to establish session keys and the like will
be of reduced quality (especially at peak times). However the
real area where hardware RNG's will be needed is for IPSec (IP
Security, encrypted TCP-IP networks), especially for high
security environments where connections are rekeyed often and
there are many connections (like 300 remote users telecommuting
to work). While the chances of an attacker intercepting the data
stream and decrypting it - as opposed to just breaking in to your
server, are slim, the possibility exists (and will grow in
future). <br>
