<p>Note: this article uses the word &quot;hacker&quot; in the
current media sponsored way, i.e. people with criminal behavior
as opposed to the original benign meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been a long, ongoing debate about this issue, and
recently it has resurfaced in public. Should companies hire
hackers convicted of computer crimes? The general theory is that
these &quot;hackers&quot; are elite commando style computer
security experts that can tighten up your network in a weekend
marathon of pizza and pop. Often nothing is further from the
truth. </p>
<p>The first concern I would have is: are these people really any
good at computer security? Now this may sound like a rather silly
question, but it bears asking. The most obvious clue would be
that they have been caught and convicted of a computer related
crime. If they are such great &quot;hackers&quot; why did they
get caught? Kevin Mitnick, a very famous hacker, was caught
several times, and spent time in jail. Most hackers possess very
little actual skill. They simply follow in the footsteps of
others. It is very easy to download precompiled exploit scripts
from sites such as rootshell and then use them to break into
systems. Even assuming for a moment that this person has any
advanced computer security skills related to breaking into
networks, this does not mean they have the skills needed to
secure networks. It is one thing to find a weakness and exploit
it, but it is an entirely different matter to fix it properly. </p>
<p>Securing a network takes a <i>lot</i> more then plugging a few
technical holes. Even if I were to walk into your network and fix
every single existing problem, it would not make your network
secure. Security is a procedure with many steps, assessment,
definition of needs, planning, implementation, review, and so
forth, which amounts to a never ending cycle. Even if you hire a
brilliant hacker that secures you against all known attacks, new
problems will crop up. Even if your hacker has these qualities,
their ethics are extremely questionable. There is a famous saying
among lawyers: &quot;never put a perjurer on the stand&quot;,
which boils down to &quot;if you know he's lied before, chances
are, he might do it again&quot;. How can you trust your newly
hired hacker not to slip backdoors into the system that they
might later exploit. While it is true that any trusted employee
might try to do something like this it certainly seems silly to
put yourself in a higher risk category. </p>
<p>A company has a fiduciary responsibility to stockholders. They
are entrusted with their stockholders' money and are expected to
make decisions that will increase it without unnecessary risk.
Engaging in high risk behavior means legal liability. For
example, would it be reasonable to sue the corporation for not
taking proper care and responsibility in hiring someone they know
to have offended before? Considering the position of trust most
security administrators are placed in (they have administrative
access to servers, monitor users' network usage, read incoming
and outgoing e-mail and so on) is it really wise to hire these
people? A person with administrative access to a server, or
physical access to the network can break into systems and leave
backdoors with nary a trace. Would you expect a bank to hire
criminals convicted of armed robbery to transport money on the
grounds they know what to look out for? Would you hire a burglar
to install the alarm system for your house? </p>
<p>While it would be nice if all criminals that got caught were
rehabilitated, used their skills for good rather than evil, and
never offended again, this is not a perfect world. By breaking
the law, for whatever reason (curiosity, maliciousness, etc.)
they have chosen to violate rules generally accepted in most
countries and societies. They have (at a bare minimum) shown poor
decision making, and while they may not specifically want to
re-offend, they may be tempted by a short term gain and take a
chance (as they have in past). </p>
<h2>Summary </h2>
<p>While it is possible to find a convicted hacker with the
skills you want, it is exceedingly rare. Even if they possess the
required skills their decision making and morality must be
questioned. Even if they are reformed and never commit a crime
again, would clients feel comfortable with the person? In general
the negatives associated with hiring a convicted hacker far
outweigh any benefits. </p>
<p>To quote a recent online article: </p>
<p>&quot;Nolan Waithe Grant was hired Aug. 16 to work at the
university computer system's help desk at a salary of $21,626.
Three years ago he pleaded guilty to hacking into the school's
Unix computer network.&quot; </p>
