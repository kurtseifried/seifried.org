<p>I'm always amazed at the lack of articles on topics like RPM
and PAM. Basic systems components and tools that people use every
day but generally speaking are poorly understood if at all.
Prepare to be educated. RPM is &quot;Red Hat Package
Manager&quot; and is currently the most widely used package
format for Linux (yes, I know about dpkg and tar packages) with
most vendors utilizing it. RPM allows you to easily install,
uninstall and query packages and the RPM database for
information. Generally speaking RPM's must be installed as root,
basically RPM's can do anything on your system, install new
files, overwriting files, reconfiguring system settings, add new
users, etc. Why is this important? Because many people download
RPM's from semi-trusted or untrusted sources and blindly install
them. </p>
<h3>Making sure RPM's are legit</h3>
<p>The first step would be to download RPM's that were created by
a trusted party (i.e. your vendor, your corporate LAN admin,
etc.) and check the GnuPG signature on them. Unfortunately there
are problems with this approach, detailed in the following
security advisory:</p>
<p><a href="http://seifried.org/security/advisories/kssa-001.html">http://seifried.org/security/advisories/kssa-001.html</a>
</p>
<p>If you want to use an RPM that comes from an untrusted source
(i.e. you found it on the web, in the contrib directory, etc.)
then you shouldn't use the binary RPM. No matter how much
verification you do of the package to make sure it won't
overwrite critical files it is always possible that an attacker
may have trojaned one or more of the binary programs contained in
the RPM. So what's the answer? Source RPM's. Simply download the
source RPM and &quot;install&quot; it (I use the term loosely
since installing a source RPM simply unpacks various files into
/usr/src/vendorname/). The spec file (located at
/usr/src/vendorname/packagename.spec) should list the official
URL to download the source tarballs (i.e. Apache 1.3.19), you can
go get signatures of the files and check them, or download the
actual files and overwrite them. To be extra careful you should
also sit down and read any patch files included with the source
rpm as it is possible for an attacker to use patch files to
introduce back doors and so forth. Lastly you should check the
spec file, this is actually one of the best vectors for an
attacker to introduce backdoors or take control of your system. </p>
<h3>RPM spec files</h3>
<p>If you haven't read an RPM spec file yet I suggest you grab a
source RPM and read along as it were. The top of the spec file is
typically informational in nature, package name, vendor, version
and so on. Then comes the interesting stuff. For many software
packages you need to do just more then lay down various files,
typically things like adding users, restarting services and
modifying global configurations needs to be done. This is
achieved by pre-install, post-install, pre-uninstall and
post-uninstall scripts. These scripts are usually written as
shell scripts but you can also use Perl, obviously since they run
as root you can do pretty much anything. In the spec file these
sections are preceded by &quot;%pre&quot;, &quot;%post&quot;,
&quot;%preun&quot; and &quot;%postun&quot;. Another cool thing
you can do with RPM's are triggers. Like a database trigger that
waits for an event (such as a record having the first name John)
RPM triggers can &quot;watch&quot; for a package to be installed
or uninstalled. Thus an attacker can place a logic bomb of sorts,
the next time you upgrade ssh for example it would add an account
with UID 0, and send out an email saying it did so. Of course
there are many other places an attacker can place malicious
instructions, such as the &quot;%pre&quot;, &quot;%build&quot;,
&quot;%install&quot; and &quot;%clean&quot;. </p>
<h3>Querying RPMs</h3>
<p>The pre-uninstall and post-install scripts are difficult to
find, one quick way to get the post install script for every
package install on your system you can simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>rpm -qa | xargs rpm -q --queryformat 'name: %{NAME}\n%{PREUN}\n\n'</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Which should give you something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>name: libtermcap
(none)

name: sed
if [ $1 = 0 ]; then
   /sbin/install-info --delete /usr/share/info/sed.info.gz /usr/share/info/dir
fi

name: slocate
if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;0&quot; ]; then 
  /usr/sbin/groupdel slocate
  rm -f /var/lib/slocate/slocate.db
fi

name: ntp
if [ $1 = 0 ]; then
    service ntpd stop &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
    /sbin/chkconfig --del ntpd
fi</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Other things you can query are PREIN, POSTIN, PREUN and
POSTUN. These are stored in /var/lib/rpm/Packages which is
unfortunately a Berkely DB file, however you can use text
utilities like grep or strings to find things (such as &quot;grep
-i rewt Packages&quot;). There are several dozen things you can
query for (name, packager, provides, requires, etc.) and these
are covered in the RPM book and online documentation. </p>
<h3>Installing RPMs</h3>
<p>Before you install an RPM you should verify that it came from
how it claims to be (i.e. check the GnuPG signature), then you
should query it to make sure there are not spurious triggers,
post-install instructions and so forth. If you are worried about
triggers you can use &quot;--triggeredby&quot; to see what a
package will trigger, if you do not want a package to trigger
anything simply use &quot;--notriggers&quot;. If you have
customized your system extensively or simply do not to run the
scripts included with an rpm you can use &quot;--noscripts&quot;,
during install it will ignore pre-install and post-install
scripts, during uninstall it will ignore pre-uninstall and
post-uninstall scripts. </p>
<h3>Building RPMs</h3>
<p>If possibly you should not build RPM's using the root account,
either chown the /usr/src/vendorname/ directory so that a non
root user or group can use it, or setup your .rpmmacros file so
that a different buildroot and tmp directory are used during the
actual build process. Personally I find it easier to have a user
like &quot;buildrpm&quot; that owns /usr/src/vendorname rather
then creating a complete set of directories for building RPM's
and so on. Another concern is the use of tmp directories by RPM,
to specify a specific tmp directory place the following in
~/.rpmmacros:</p>
<pre>%_tmppath /home/user/tmp</pre>
<p>One thing to note is that RPM strips the leading
&quot;/&quot;'s from files when unpacking tar archives so you
need not worry about an attacker creating a tarball with
&quot;/etc/passwd&quot; for example. When possible you should
have a system dedicated to building rpm's that is heavily
secured, just imagine if an attacker managed to break into a
machine used be a vendor to build RPM's, or onto the one you use
for building updated RPM's for your company's servers.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>RPM is a very complex and powerful tool for building software
packages. Blindly downloading and installing RPM's is of course
very dangerous (this goes for installing software on any
operating system). If you choose to build foreign RPM's on your
machine then you should inspect the SPEC file for malicious
commands and also verify the source code used and any patches.
The good news however is that verifying the origin of RPM's is
relatively easy, and as the majority of your RPM's will likely
come from trusted sources then you should not have too many
problems. Lastly with the use of scripts and triggers you can
easily build RPM's that will notify you when installed (i.e. put
a command to send mail out so you know when someone has upgraded
a machine), or properly clean up after themselves. Used properly
RPM is a very powerful tool.</p>
