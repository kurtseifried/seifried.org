<p>In a previous article I covered the basics of format string
attacks. This time I've interviewed Chris Evans, whom I quoted in
the last article. Without further ado, here is the interview.
Read it - you will learn something. (I did.)</p>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Q:</td>
<td valign="top">It appears to me that these format
strings have been present a very long time. A CERT
advisory mentioned them being in WuFTPD since 1993. Do
you think attackers have known about them and been using
them? (This certainly would be a convenient explanation
for many mysterious unsolved break-ins.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">A:</td>
<td valign="top">This is a very interesting question. It
depends what you mean by &quot;attackers.&quot; I doubt
this problem was widely known in the underground cracker
community. When that is the case, the exploit usually
leaks to the public. I can happily entertain that a few
highly skilled individuals knew about this issue, though.
Finally, we should be wary of attributing any unsolved
break-ins to format string bugs. Even if a compromised
site was running daemons containing format string bugs,
there is still the potential for undiscovered security
bugs which are not of a format string nature.<p>As we
know, string/buffer handling has traditionally been very
buggy. The most obvious example of buggy buffer handling
is the classic buffer overflow.</p>
<p>The problem is that programmers tend to just treat a
string or buffer as a &quot;chunk of memory.&quot; This
gives the programmer tedious chores such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When copying or appending strings, make sure the
destination buffer is large enough.</li>
<li>If the destination buffer isn't large enough, do
we truncate? Allocate a new bigger buffer? Error
out? </li>
</ul>
<p>All the calculations and checks involved in some of
the above ways of coding are easy to get wrong. Also,
code readability is reduced. It can be difficult to
analyze the logic of a program because it is buried in
buffer parsing and management.</p>
<p>The solution is break the association between
string/buffer, and &quot;chunk of memory.&quot; Instead
of manipulating and copying things all over the place, we
can manipulate an opaque object which just happens to
internally manage a buffer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, instead of:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>{
&nbsp; char buf[BUFSIZE];
&nbsp; strcpy(buf, data);
&nbsp; strcat(buf, more_data);
}</pre>
<p>we have</p>
<pre>{
&nbsp; struct safe_buf the_buf;
&nbsp; safe_buf_init(data);
&nbsp; safe_buf_append(more_data);
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The former case is easy to get wrong. The latter case
introduces an API which is very hard to use in an
insecure manner. That is the key thing.</p>
<p>The safe_buf thing in fact boils down to little more
than a C version of a classic C++ string or buffer class.
You can happily push some string parsing into the
safe_buf code too, e.g. string splitting, string
substitutions, etc.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that the highly secure mail
server &quot;qmail&quot; employs this technique for
secure string handling (although I haven't looked at the
source to confirm). Have you seen a string/buffer
handling bug in qmail lately ;-) </p>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Q:</td>
<td valign="top">Like buffer overflows, bugs are due to
programmers. Do you think programmers will ever break
themselves of these habits/mistakes? Or are development
tools the answer, like source code scanners such as ITS4?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">A:</td>
<td valign="top">Broadly, I think highly secure code
requires two things.<ol>
<li>A high quality implementation</li>
<li>A design resistant to flaws in the implementation</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, even the best and most security-aware
programmers are only human, and make mistakes. High(er)
quality implementations can be achieved with a number of
measures;</p>
<ul>
<li>Using security-aware and good programmers to
write security sensitive code.</li>
<li>Thorough code auditing of security sensitive
code. Source scanners have their place, but they
are no substitute for one, or preferably more
humans reviewing code.<br>
</li>
<li>Throwing away coding styles and/or APIs which are
error prone. (There is a very interesting example
I could give here which illustrates that buffer
overflows can be a non-problem if you change your
coding style.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we have taken steps to maximize the quality of
code, there may unfortunately still be problems left. The
recent &quot;rpc.statd&quot; exploit illustrates this.
rpc.statd is a well audited piece of code, but a format
string bug slipped through because at the times of the
audits, no-one was looking for them. This is where a
fault tolerant design comes in.</p>
<p>A fault tolerant design essentially minimizes the
degree of privilege that bugs are able to give attackers.
Obviously, one way this can be achieved under UNIX is by
running as little code as possible as root. Other tools
available to UNIX programmers sometimes include
chroot()/jailing facilities and capabilities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most code isn't fault tolerant. A lot
of daemons and services just permanently keep high levels
of privilege. Not because they need it, but because it
makes coding easier. It takes a non-trivial amount of
effort to factor out parts of a program which genuinely
_need_ privilege. Take something like the OpenSSH server.
It has a good quality of implementation, largely because
its security critical nature has inspired many audits.
However, if a security hole is ever found in OpenSSH, its
severity is likely to be a full machine compromise. That
really need not be the case.</p>
<p>In summary, a way to ensure security despite the
presence of the always fallible programmer, is through
auditing and fault tolerant design requirements.</p>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Q:</td>
<td valign="top">I'm curious to know if you have seen
SubDomain (from WireX). If so, what do you think of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">A:</td>
<td valign="top">I have heard of SubDomain, from the same
people, I expect this might be the same thing as CoDomain
(<a href="http://immunix.org/products.html">http://immunix.org/products.html</a>
gives some blurb).<p>I don't know all the gory details,
but SubDomain is another application of the
&quot;principle of least privilege,&quot; giving much
better system resilience in the presence of security
holes you don't yet know about. </p>
<p>The SubDomain documentation, at the above URL,
mentions enhanced file access control a lot. Hopefully,
not just files will be protected, but also network access
and process access. To generalize, the entire kernel API
could use some decent protection. I like to visualize
this protection as a &quot;syscall firewall.&quot;</p>
<p>The existence of multiple projects with similar goals
(SubDomain, Janus) shows a frustration that chroot() and,
more recently, Linux kernel capabilities, are a step in
the right direction, but simply not fine grained enough
to apply the principle of least privilege properly.</p>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Q:</td>
<td valign="top">Do you think that like buffer overflows
and format strings, there are more of these
&quot;fundamental&quot; problems lying around, waiting to
be found? </td>

<td valign="top">A:</td>
<td valign="top">In the security world, we have to assume
that yes, there are more undiscovered fundamental
problems lying around. It would be foolish and
short-sighted not to.<p>If we keep this threat in mind
while writing code, it should help lead to fault tolerant
solutions. The &quot;remote-root&quot; severity of the
recent holes in WuFTPD, BSD-ftpd, rpc.statd and,
probably, LPRng, simply would not have occurred in the
presence of code with a good design from a security point
of view.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top">Q:</td>
<td valign="top">You mention fault tolerance several
times. What do you think of things such as Linux's kernel
capabilities, The Openwall kernel patch and StackGuard
from WireX? Are they an answer, or do we need more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">A:</td>
<td valign="top">I'll take these three things separately.<p>Linux
kernel capabilities - these are a useful tool for
reducing the impact of a vulnerability in a program or
daemon. A superb example is a network time daemon. Why
should it run with full privilege when the single
privilege &quot;change the system clock time&quot; is
required? Capabilities solve this nicely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for some other uses, they are not
really fine grained enough. Two quick examples are</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening on a privileged network port. With
capabilities it's &quot;none of them&quot; or
&quot;all of them.&quot; It would be nice to
nominate the ability to listen on a specific
network port, like you mention below.</li>
<li>Ability to change the ownership on a file.
Currently, this is either &quot;you can't,&quot;
or, &quot;change any file to any owner.&quot;
Better granularity would specify a list of
allowable previous and new owners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Openwall kernel patch - an interesting collection of
patches. Some of these are geared towards making certain
types of exploit harder or impossible, which is good.
Classic security hardening. By far the most discussed
component of this patchset, though, is the &quot;non-exec
stack&quot; patch. This is essentially a defense against
your traditional stack buffer overflow. Unfortunately,
stack overflows are still exploitable with this patch in
place. It just requires a different exploit. People
concentrate on why this is bad, i.e. you are just as
exploitable with or without this patch. However, another
important facet is that your average script kiddie will
be foiled by this patch, and move onto another target
which is not as well protected (obfuscated, some might
say). This will remain true for as long as the number of
installations without this protection is relatively
large. If this protection because commonplace, exploits
would simply be released targeted at systems with the
non-exec stack patch in place.</p>
<p>StackGuard - another solution to stack based buffer
overflows, but one which will make some stack overflow
bugs unexploitable. This is a very useful layer of
security to add. If your extensive code audit were to
miss a stack overflow (and this happens), then you may
still not be exploitable.</p>
<p>The direction I'd like to see things take, is better
OS support for applications to describe the precise set
of privilege they need. If done properly, most
applications would run with sufficiently low privilege
that a compromise would be only a fraction as serious as
one is today.</p>
<p>Things like StackGuard have a place too - namely
targeting a common flaw and preventing it being a
problem. In an ideal world, we would just nail the
problem in the first place. However, this is not an ideal
world, and some instances of &quot;problem&quot; get
missed during auditing.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top">Q:</td>
<td valign="top">I have seen other projects in progress.
One that intrigued me was the ability to assign a port to
a user/group (a la file ownership) so that, say,
&quot;dnssrvr&quot; could use port 53 and not ever need
to touch root. If you had a wish list of such items, what
would the top three be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">A:</td>
<td valign="top">Nice question :)<ol>
<li>Better OS support for jailing<p>By
&quot;jailing,&quot; I mean placing strong
restrictions on what a process is allowed to do.
The only thing close to this in common UNIX use
at the moment is chroot(). This essentially is
restricting what files a compromised process can
execute or open/read. Preventing arbitrary file
execution is very powerful, because via suid-root
binaries, it is a way of leveraging higher
privilege.</p>
<p>This needs to be extended to the ability to
deny other system interactions such as
making/receiving network connections, signals,
using shared memory, allocating memory, creating
processes, etc. </p>
<p>Turning the problem on its head, doing
anything should be denied to a daemon/server,
apart from things it specifically needs to do.
For some network servers you need little more
than read()/write() on an existing network
connection, plus the ability to open a small
subset of the filesystem read-only. All other
syscalls should be denied, which also has the
pleasant effect of protecting from many potential
kernel flaws which might be used to gain
privilege.</p>
<p>I haven't looked at the implementation yet,
but &quot;Janus&quot; sounds very promising along
these lines; <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/janus/">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/janus/</a></p>
<p>For a final different perspective on better
jailing, consider a cracker who has found a
security hole in a FTP server, which they then
use to be able to execute arbitrary code. Imagine
their frustration at not being able to execute
/usr/bin/suidperl to gain root privs. Not being
able to connect out to other systems. Not being
able to DoS the local machine.. etc..</p>
</li>
<li>Reclassifying existing UNIX rights as
capabilities<p>If I login as &quot;chris&quot; to
my local machine, I get dropped at what is termed
an unprivileged shell. In fact, it is not
unprivileged in the slightest. I will find myself
able to set up network servers. Connect out to
other machines on the Internet. Run privileged
binaries.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to extend the
capabilities system to make capabilities of some
things that current operating systems allow by
default to normal users.</p>
</li>
<li>Rewrite/re-architecting of existing software<p>Maybe
this doesn't count in the context of the question
you asked :) However, most existing software
fails to use the privilege limitation/jailing
facilities available to it. If better jailing
facilities do become standard, then software will
start to look _really_ outdated from a security
standpoint. So, my wish list finishes with
overhauling (or replacing) a lot of security
sensitive software.</p>
