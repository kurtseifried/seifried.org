<p>When you ask most network and system administrators about
system and network security, they'll respond, &quot;We have a
firewall&quot; or &quot;We use SSL encryption.&quot; This is all
fine and good. However, there are often some things they have
missed - not that it is really their fault, since these
additional options are not very well documented in most cases.
Almost all Unix-based operating systems have the capability to
modify various kernel options while the system is running. I'll
be concentrating on Linux, *BSD and Solaris. </p>
<p>All three have different facilities for modifying kernel
configuration on the fly. Solaris uses ndd and generally
manipulates /dev/ entries; Linux uses the /proc interface; and
BSD uses sysctl to &quot;get or set kernel state&quot; (quote
from man sysctl). For my examples I will be using Solaris 8.0 on
an Ultrasparc, Red Hat 7.0 and OpenBSD 2.8, both on Intel
platforms. </p>
<h3>Where to Find and How to Set the Options</h3>
<p>BSD's sysctl is probably the easiest to use. Simply execute</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sysctl -a</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>to get a listing of all the options available, and what their
current settings are. &quot;man sysctl&quot; also tells you what
type of data it is and whether (and how) you can modify it. </p>
<p>In Linux, you will need to </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>cat /proc/foo/bar</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>for each setting to see what it is set to. For a list of all
the possible options, get a copy of the kernel source code
(usually in /usr/src/linux). The file
&quot;Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt&quot; lists their
defaults and so on. Another useful file in the Linux kernel
source is &quot;Documentation/proc.txt,&quot; which covers /proc
in general. </p>
<p>In Solaris, ndd lets you &quot;get and set driver
configuration parameters.&quot; It only applies to
network-related items right now. Solaris also lets you query all
the options available. Simply run</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ndd /dev/foo</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>where &quot;foo&quot; is one of: arp, ip, ip6, tcp, tcp6, udp,
udp6, rawip, rawip6, hme (or other network interfaces). There are
probably some I missed, but these will give you a good start.
Then enter a &quot;?&quot; at the prompt to list all the options
you can fiddle with. You can also issue the &quot;?&quot; with
the device to get a list of options.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ndd /dev/tcp ?</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Routing Data</h3>
<p>So, why would you want to modify the kernel on the fly - what
good could it possibly do you from a security point of view? A
simple example would be the need to route packets on a system. In
almost all operating systems, this is disabled by default.
Enabling it by default would create a large security risk in many
environments. Requiring someone to build a new kernel capable of
routing packets would be extremely troublesome, so instead most
operating systems have the capability built in, just disabled by
default. In Linux this would be accomplished by:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In OpenBSD, with:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And in Solaris:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ndd -set /dev/ip ip_forwarding 0</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the exact syntax varies but the general idea
is the same.</p>
<h3>Source Routed Packets</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, the only people that would want to source
route packets are hostile attackers. Source routing can be useful
for sliding packets around firewalls and IDS systems or targeting
specific machines. The default in Linux is to disable source
routed packets in the kernel, and many firewalls also allow you
to block source routed packets, however it is just as easy to
block them at the OS level.</p>
<p>In Linux, simply have a bash script.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>for i in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/accept_source_route 
do
	echo 0 &gt; $i
done</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will do all the interfaces - lo, eth0, ppp0, etc.</p>
<p>In OpenBSD, you would:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sysctl -w net.inet.ip.sourceroute=0</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this is disabled by default, so you shouldn't need to
take care of it.</p>
<p>In Solaris,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ndd -set /dev/ip ip_forward_src_routed 0</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will also set ip_forward_source_routed to 0 on /dev/tcp,
/dev/udp and other appropriate devices (tcp6, ip6, etc.).</p>
<p>And now for some OS-specific options.</p>
<h3>Solaris</h3>
<p>Solaris has some of the coolest options, in my opinion. You
can add and remove privileged ports arbitrarily. For example, to
make port 2049 (udp) privileged:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ndd -set /dev/udp udp_extra_priv_ports_add 2049</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also make ports non-privileged, but remember that if
you do so, some security implications arise. For example, if you
have port 2049 as a privileged port, but you then remove that
privileged status, it is possible for a local user to run an NFS
service should the &quot;real&quot; one crash or otherwise be
disabled. You should be cautious in making ports non-privileged.
Most services now drop root immediately once they have bound to
the privileged port, or only run a small control program as root
- Apache, Bind, Postfix, etc. </p>
<p>Also, in Solaris you can set the following in /etc/system.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>set noexec_user_stack = 1
set noexec_stack_user_stack_log = 1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This should provide some protection against malicious code,
although I wouldn't bet the farm on it, as there are ways to
avoid this type of thing, assuming it works properly.</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Linux has a nice option for multihomed hosts. If you have a
Linux box set up as a router for a reasonably small network
(i.e., it's not a core router), then you can use reverse path
filtering to prevent IP spoofing. While you can also do this with
a firewall, it requires less effort and maintenance to do it with
the kernel option. The default is to set it to 1, which is
reasonably safe. For more security you may wish to set it to 2;
however, this will have a performance hit and there are some
situations in which your network may be configured in such a way
that having strict reverse path checking breaks.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>for i in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter
do
	echo 1 &gt; $i
done</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>OpenBSD</h3>
<p>In OpenBSD you can easily modify the behavior of TCP and UDP.
You can set the port ranges for outgoing connections, which will
allow you to build very tight firewall rules if you wish to do
so. The sysctl properties (and their defaults) are:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>net.inet.ip.portfirst = 1024
net.inet.ip.portlast = 49151
net.inet.ip.porthifirst = 49152
net.inet.ip.porthilast = 65535</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To set net.inet.ip.portfirst to a higher number, simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sysctl -w net.inet.ip.portfirst = 10240</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As you might now realize, there are many hidden or poorly
documented security features available in most operating systems.
While the majority of people can't be bothered to take basic
security measures, there is a growing population of
administrators who are willing to do whatever it takes to harden
their networks and make them less vulnerable to security
incidents. Hopefully vendors will better document these features,
if enough demand appears - which is doubtful. So if you find
anything interesting, share it with your peers.</p>
