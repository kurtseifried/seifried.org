Interview with Chris Evans</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">In a previous article I covered the basics
of format string attacks. This time I've interviewed Chris
Evans, whom I quoted in the last article. Without further
ado, here is the interview. Read it - you will learn
something. (I did.)</font></p>

Security - Kernel Options</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">When you ask most network and system
administrators about system and network security, they'll
respond, &quot;We have a firewall&quot; or &quot;We use SSL
encryption.&quot; This is all fine and good. However, there
are often some things they have missed - not that it is
really their fault, since these additional options are not
very well documented in most cases. Almost all Unix-based
operating systems have the capability to modify various
kernel options while the system is running. I'll be
concentrating on Linux, *BSD and Solaris. </font></p>

and Preventing Backdoors in UNIX Systems</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Backdoors are by far one of the worst
nightmares of many system and network administrators. We all
know our networks and hosts will at some point be penetrated,
and if we've done our job right we should be able to detect
that penetration. However, one problem always rears its ugly
head: Do we format the drive, reinstall from trusted media,
then patch the system, configure it, and restore data from
backups; or do we just try to patch the system up and remove
any surprises the attacker may have left? In some cases it is
clear-cut: For a user's workstation with most data stored
centrally, rebuilding the system is far faster than trying to
fix it. On the other hand, what if you have a production
email server handling incoming email for 10,000 people and no
backup machine to switch to? </font></p>

<p><a href="20010924-care-feeding-rpm.html">Care and feeding of
RPM</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">I'm always amazed at the lack of articles
on topics like RPM and PAM. Basic systems components and
tools that people use every day but generally speaking are
poorly understood if at all. Prepare to be educated. RPM is
&quot;Red Hat Package Manager&quot; and is currently the most
widely used package format for Linux (yes, I know about dpkg
and tar packages) with most vendors utilizing it. RPM allows
you to easily install, uninstall and query packages and the
RPM database for information. Generally speaking RPM's must
be installed as root, basically RPM's can do anything on your
system, install new files, overwriting files, reconfiguring
system settings, add new users, etc. Why is this important?
Because many people download RPM's from semi-trusted or
untrusted sources and blindly install them. </font></p>

<p><a href="20010924-postfix.html">Postfix</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Most, if not all the readers of this column
run a mail server, and more then likely it is running
Sendmail. In all fairness Sendmail is a damn good MTA (Mail
Transfer Agent), Eric Allman originally wrote it with one
main goal in mind: the mail must get through. Unfortunately,
when Sendmail was originally written security wasn't a major
concern on the Internet and it shows. Sendmail runs almost
exclusively as the root user on most systems, meaning any
flaws are potentially very serious.&nbsp;In addition to this
Sendmail isn't very good at handling high loads. New mailers,
such as Postfix, Zmailer, and Qmail are several times faster
then Sendmail on the same hardware. Until recently most of
the alternative mailers to Sendmail were not drop-in
replacements, to replace Sendmail was a painful task, and the
new software typically behaved differently then Sendmail.
Postfix was designed from the start to address all these
problems.</font></p>
