<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most, if not all the readers of this column run a mail server,
and more then likely it is running Sendmail. In all fairness
Sendmail is a damn good MTA (Mail Transfer Agent), Eric Allman
originally wrote it with one main goal in mind: the mail must get
through. Unfortunately, when Sendmail was originally written
security wasn't a major concern on the Internet and it shows.
Sendmail runs almost exclusively as the root user on most
systems, meaning any flaws are potentially very serious.&nbsp;In
addition to this Sendmail isn't very good at handling high loads.
New mailers, such as Postfix, Zmailer, and Qmail are several
times faster then Sendmail on the same hardware. Until recently
most of the alternative mailers to Sendmail were not drop-in
replacements, to replace Sendmail was a painful task, and the new
software typically behaved differently then Sendmail. Postfix was
designed from the start to address all these problems.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Postfix does not run exclusively as root, instead a master
program (called &quot;master&quot;) runs as root and spawns off
processes to handle incoming, outgoing and local mail delivery as
needed. Using a series of modular components, each task is
handled by a separate program (which makes auditing it easier),
for example outgoing email is dumped into the queue directory by
your software, where &quot;pickup&quot; gets it and hands it to
&quot;cleanup&quot;, which hands it to
&quot;trivial-rewrite&quot; which handles the headers, and
finally is given to &quot;smtp&quot; if bound for a foreign
system. Postfix is also much easier to setup for a chroot'ed
environment than Sendmail is, simply make a few edits to the
master.cf file (typically in /etc/postfix) and Postfix will run
chroot'ed in its defined queue directory (usually
/var/spool/postfix). It is also possible to set process limits
for individual portions of postfix, again in the master.cf file.
You can also easily set which user the Postfix programs run as,
typically it defaults to &quot;postfix&quot; (a user similar in
concept to the &quot;nobody&quot; user for apache), which has
access to certain queue directories. Another major benefit of
Postfix is the clarity of the configuration files, if you haven't
yet looked at the guts of a sendmail.cf file I would recommend
that you don't (O'Reilly has an 800 page book on Sendmail).</p>
<p>The master.cf file:</p>

<h3>Replacing Sendmail</h3>
<p>As stated before, replacing Sendmail with another MTA used to
be a very painful task, many mailers approached the
&quot;problems&quot; in Sendmail by doing things quite
differently and require a pretty extensive overhaul of the mail
system, and a very different set of configuration files. With
Postfix you can use most of your existing configuration files
(such as access, aliases, virtusertable, etc.) simply by defining
them appropriately in the main.cf file. In addition to this
Postfix behaves like Sendmail, you can invoke it using
&quot;sendmail&quot;, get a listing of the mailq with
&quot;mailq&quot;, feed it pretty much the same options and so
forth. I find a typical Postfix conversion takes around 10
minutes for most sites (assuming you use an RPM and don't have to
compile it), and have yet to encounter any major disasters
(although I have found several small to medium sized
glitches).&nbsp;</p>
<h3>New problems</h3>
<p>Of course replacing one software package with another will
solve certain problems, and create new ones, to which Postfix is
no exception. Partly due to it's design as a secure MTA you may
experience some minor problems with Postfix. The best example is
email to root, Postfix, by default, does not like to deliver
email with elevated privileges (necessary to send email to root
typically). You will need to define an alias for root in the
aliases file, such as: &quot;root: someuser&quot;. This also
leads to problems with several mailing list packages, especially
SmartList, which by default does all sorts of funky things that
Postfix will not stand for. In any case I would advise switching
to Majordomo, it is easier to configure and maintain via email
for owners of mailing lists.</p>
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>A major issue with Sendmail used to be scalability, and even
now the default configuration tends to require significant tuning
to get fast performance. Another issue is sites are starting to
handle email for 10's of thousands of users on a single server,
and using flat text files for configuration details such as
mapping outgoing user email addresses (to make bob appear as from
<a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="deadbfb2bbad9ebba6bfb3aeb2bbf0b1acb9">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> for example). This file could become several
hundred thousand lines long in the future and slow the system
down. Postfix can however be integrated with a database backend
(currently MySQL is supported) to host it's configuration files,
which not only scales better but allows you to do things such as
dynamically blocking email to and from certain sites, and allow
users to administrate their own accounts more easily (a database
beats a flat file any day).&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Licensing</h3>
<p>The IBM Open Source License is surprisingly liberal. Previous
versions had a rather ugly termination clause, which prevented
wide spread acceptance of Postfix, however this has been removed
and Postfix is now &quot;safe&quot; to use. You can distribute
the software, develop it, make changes and so forth, the only
catch being that you must contribute any changes back to IBM
(rather reasonable since they paid Wietse to develop it).&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Qmail</h3>
<p>Some of you are probably wondering why I haven't mentioned
Qmail yet, or written an article &quot;Qmail - the Sendmail
replacement&quot;. I have tested Qmail, and used it for a while,
in general I found (and several sites I communicated with, one
being a large Linux vendor) Qmail to be very painful to configure
and maintain. In addition to this the Qmail license is very
unclear, and doesn't even ship with the software. To quote the
author: &quot;If you want to distribute modified versions of
qmail (including ports, no matter how minor the changes are)
you'll have to get my approval.&quot; This and other issues have
hindered Qmail's acceptance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Technical side of Postfix</h2>
<p>This article was written using Postfix snapshot 20001030.
Since then several things (like virtual) have changed, making
some points in this article incorrect.</p>
<h3><b>Check_recipient_access</b></h3>
<p>This is probably the best way of restricting incoming email to
valid email accounts only. Let's assume you have a decent-sized
corporate LAN based on Windows and are using Exchange server for
email. Exchange can only validate incoming email based on the
domain, not the user, and since it will attempt to deliver the
email for 48 hours, your system can get quickly clogged up - with
no easy way to clean it out. Place your Exchange server behind a
firewall so no one on the Internet can connect to it directly,
and then place a Postfix server on the public side. Add this to
your main.cf:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>smtpd_sender_restrictions = check_recipient_access
 hash:/etc/postfix/access-inbound</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Then in your /etc/postfix/access-inbound file, simply put,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="780e1914111c0d0b1d0a381d00191508141d56170a1f">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>	OK
example.org		REJECT</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You will also need to create the hash file. The following
command will do so:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>postmap /etc/postfix/access</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You could also use the generic access file, but splitting it
up allows for extremely selective access controls. You can then
have the mail delivered locally or forwarded to another
(internal) system. If an email is sent to an email address not
listed specifically, and the domain is covered by a reject rule,
the sender will receive an email with an error like,</p>

Recipient address rejected: Access denied</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also specify a custom error such as &quot;useraccount
does not exist.&quot; However, a spammer could theoretically use
this to build an address list by simply testing all the email
addresses - those that generate an error message do not exist,
and those that do not generate one do exist.</p>
<h3>Virtual</h3>
<p>This feature can be used as intended, for having virtual users
(i.e., if you handle multiple domains and more than one wants a
webmaster@ email address) as well as for protecting internal
servers. </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>virtual_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual</pre>

<p>Then in your /etc/postfix/virtual simply remap email:</p>

@example.org		bounce-local</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You will also need to create the hash file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>postmap /etc/postfix/virtual</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If incoming email does not match a virtual user, mapping it is
sent to another address, in this example a local user called
&quot;bounce-local.&quot; It may then be blackholed to /dev/null,
simply bounced (no such user), or sent to an admin email account
- where it is deleted or forwarded to the correct person, if an
obvious typo was made in the address, or whatever. You can also
use a database backend instead of a hash or dbm file. This is
definitely the way to go for large installations. See man
virtual(5) for more information. Simply use the same machine as
the outbound mail server (i.e., smart host) and it will rewrite
the email addresses outgoing from @internal-mail.example.org to
@example.org (or whatever you want).</p>
<h3>Local_recipient_maps</h3>
<p>This keyword lets you allow only local delivery of email to
valid users and/or definitions in the aliases map. Thus any email
bound for a nonexistent user gets bounced immediately with an
error message saying the user does not exist. This is useful if
you the postmaster do not want to receive as many error messages.
Potentially, however, an attacker could use this to find valid
names (anything valid won't generate an error). This is probably
most useful for large installations such as ISPs and large
corporations. An additional consideration would be to use
relocated_maps. Simply put this in your main.cf:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>local_recipient_maps = $alias_maps unix:passwd.byname</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will accept any email defined in aliases or for user
accounts in the password database.</p>
<h3>Relocated_maps</h3>
<p>This is an ideal feature for large companies that want to
remap users without too much trouble. It allows you to specify
the original email address and the new email address. For
example, user joebob goes to another ISP instead of forwarding
all their mail, which results in senders not realizing it has
changed. They get an error message specifying the new email
address. This can be used for wholesale domain moves as well.
Simply add the following to your main.cf:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>relocated_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/relocated</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Then put the email address, username or domain name, followed
by the email address or domain name, and anyone sending email in
will get a nice error telling them the new address. See man
relocated(5) for more information.</p>
<h3>Blocking Spam</h3>
<p>This is probably one of the favorite features for
administrators; under Postfix it is trivial to implement. Simple
add the following to your main.cf:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>maps_rbl_domains = rbl.maps.vix.com, dul.maps.vix.com </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The rbl is the real-time blackhole list, basically a list of
known spammers and open relays that spammers use. The dul is the
dialup list. Generally speaking, you shouldn't be receiving to
much email <i>directly</i> from dialup users, i.e., people using
their own servers. However, quite a few legitimate users do set
up their own email servers for use on dialup links, and blocking
them inadvertently may be a problem. </p>
<h3>Database Backends</h3>
<p>One thing I really love about Postfix is the ability to use
databases instead of flat text files or hash and dbm files.
Currently only MySQL is supported, but that is more than
sufficient for most users. You must first compile in support for
MySQL. See the &quot;MYSQL_README&quot; file for more information
on this. Then you simply create a table in the MySQL database of
usernames, virtual mappings or whatever. The cool thing is, this
allows for very efficient sharing of configuration files between
servers; and since you can specify multiple MySQL servers, you
can replicate the database and avoid a single point of failure as
well as being able to vary the order the databases are listed in
on various servers, as a simplistic form of load balancing.</p>
<p>MySQL has plans to add database replication to its available
features. For now, you will have to create your own solution,
such as a simple tool that connects to and updates all the
databases at once. The configuration is reasonably simple. In
your main.cf, put something like,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>alias_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql-aliases.cf</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then in the mysql-aliases.cf, put</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>user = someone<br>
password = some_password <br>
dbname = customer_database<br>
table = mxaliases<br>
select_field = forw_addr<br>
where_field = alias<br>
additional_conditions = and status = 'paid'<br>
hosts = maildb1.example.org maildbt2.example.org</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would allow you to have a table called
&quot;mxaliases&quot; in the database called
&quot;customer_database,&quot; where the field
&quot;forw_addr&quot; matches and where the &quot;status&quot;
field is set to &quot;paid&quot; (so you can easily block email
to customers who don't fork over). The really useful thing is
that you can easily update configuration files on the fly. As
soon as it is updated in the database, it's ready to go.
Additionally, this makes giving users control over their own
accounts much easier. A Web hosting provider could easily let
people handle virtual user mappings on their own domain, for
example, through a cgi interface.</p>
<h3>TLS</h3>
<p>Transport Layer Security is to email as SSL is to Web
browsing. TLS allows you to encrypt email transfers from server
to server, but more importantly, it allows you to add
authentication to the mail server. Instead of having to allow
access based on IP and hostname, you can use usernames and
passwords. That way people can connect securely from off-site -
while using dialup on the road - and spammers are not able to use
you as a relay.</p>
<p>There is an add-on TLS package for Postfix (see URL at bottom)
available from Germany. (Germany is very pro-encryption; the
federal government has even gone so far as to sponsor GnuPG
development.) TLS is becoming more common now that the RSA patent
has expired. Red Hat 7.1 ships Postfix configured for TLS out of
the box.</p>
<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>Postfix supports the use of regular expressions for header
rewriting and other neat tricks. There's support for basic regex
(regexp), and support for perl-compatible regular expressions
(PCRE). The first are simpler. To use them, just put this in your
main.cf:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header-checks</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And then add rules to your header-checks file; the target can
be REJECT, OK or a custom error.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/^Subject: Make money fast/		REJECT
/^X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express/	REJECT</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>See man regexp_table(5) for more information. You can also use
PCRE by simply specifying pcre: instead of regexp: in your
main.cf. The rules are basically the same, except that the syntax
used for pattern matching is a bit more advanced.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/^friend@(?!my.domain).*$/ 550 Stick this in your pipe $0</pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Postfix is ideal for large installations, with its database
backends and extremely tight control of mail delivery.
Additionally, it supports numerous security features, such as TLS
and even the ability to specify which users are allowed to send
mail off-site and which aren't - again, in a very selective
manner. Qmail has quite a few of these features, but has one
significant problem: The license makes it extremely difficult to
distribute in a binary format, which is what most people want.</p>
<p>Postfix, on the other hand, comes under the IBM Public
License, which is surprisingly considerate to end users. My real
favorite is the simplicity of configuration. An average main.cf
is under 30 lines of configuration directives. Hopefully more
vendors will start shipping Postfix with their distributions.</p>
