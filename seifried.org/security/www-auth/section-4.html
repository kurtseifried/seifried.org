<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All authentication systems depend on some type of shared secret or
shared knowledge. This can be a password or the same X.509 public key
of a root certificate.</P>
<P><STRONG>4.1 Local methods</STRONG></P>
<P>Data used to authenticate users can be stored locally on the
machine, or provided from a network server. If all you have is one
machine then using a local method is fine, however if you need to add
another machine you will have to change things, so going with a
server based solution can be much cheaper in the long run.
</P>
<P><STRONG>4.1.1 System username/passwd database</STRONG></P>
<P>Most UNIX style systems contain a password file (/etc/passwd) and
a shadow passwords file (/etc/shadow). You can authenticate a user
against these, however the CGI must have some form of root access or
access to setuid root program to do the authentication. This is not
highly recommended. In addition having users use their &quot;real&quot;
username and password to a site increases the chance of exposure
somewhat and is probably not a good idea. I would not highly
recommend this method.</P>
<P><STRONG>4.1.2 WWW server username/password database</STRONG></P>
<P>Apache and most other web servers can consult a flat text file
consisting of username:hashed_password pairs (similar to an
/etc/passwd style file) or a database file such as dbm (for increased
speed). This is quite appropriate and workable for single server
installations but does not scale easily (you must somehow keep files
in synchronization across multiple servers), unless of course adding
user accounts and changing passwords is not a priority (i.e. if the
files are relatively static). This is a recommended method for single
server installations.</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2 Network based methods</STRONG></P>
<P>Network based authentication systems scale much better then
locally based methods (such as a password file). The other advantage
is that almost all networks have some form of network based
authentication going (for people to log into workstations, etc.) so
it saves a significant amount of effort in maintaining another set of
usernames and passwords if you can tie into the existing schemes. For
future growth and scalability in general (as well as redundancy) I
would generally recommend using a network based method over a locally
based method.
</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.1 NIS/NIS+ server</STRONG></P>
<P>This is one of the original methods of sharing authentication data
across networks. NIS and NIS+ essentially copy chunks of config files
(such as /etc/passwd) to machines, typically one machine (the master)
propagates copies of the config files to secondary servers (slaves)
which the client machines actually query. NIS/NIS+ is relatively
insecure in that the data moves around the network in an unprotected
format, so sniffing the network and collecting a lot of user data is
relatively simple. About the only advantage of NIS/NIS+ is that
almost all UNIX operating systems have native support for it, and
configuration is typically not to difficult (not much security is
involved which simplifies things).
</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.2 SMB server</STRONG></P>
<P>SMB (Server Message Block) is the backbone of Microsoft file and
print sharing services. Many networks run NT servers with NT and
Windows clients, typically using Microsoft's built in authentication
systems (as opposed to say NDS for NT). The primary reason to use SMB
as your www authentication provider would be to tie www
authentication into an existing NT framework. If running NT server
with IIS this is as simple as placing directory permissions on the
appropriate directories, users access the site (from Windows only of
course) will be automatically logged in (assuming they logged in with
the correct username and password). This can be very useful for
company Intranets. Most UNIX systems support SAMBA, which provides
Windows file and print sharing, as well as domain authentication
services, so you can have the data locally on the server which
reduces time to check username and passwords. The algorithms used
however to move this data around are relatively weak (not as bad as
NIS/NIS+ though), so be aware of that.</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.3 LDAP server</STRONG></P>
<P>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an increasingly
popular method for storing and sharing user data. There are several
LDAP products (including OpenLDAP, an OpenSource implementation), and
many current and future directory services products include an LDAP
interface (such as Novell's NDS and Microsoft's ADS). Many UNIX
server products now support LDAP internally (such as Apache,
ProFTPD), as well as support in programming languages such as Perl
(one of the dominant CGI languages). LDAP is also very extensible, if
you want to add the user's home directory information to the
information held and make it accessible you can do so (and then for
example Apache can retrieve that data when it gets a request for
/~username/). LDAP is probably going to be one of the dominant
methods in the future due to it's portability and spreading usage for
authentication in general.</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.4 Certificate authority server</STRONG></P>
<P>If you plan to use digital certificates for authentication then
you will need a certificate authority, to handle revocation, issuing
of new certificates, and so on. The alternative is to use a third
party (such as Verisign) and pay a yearly fee for each user,
additionally giving up a certain degree of control to them. Using
certificates, especially those based on smartcards (which is the only
remotely secure option) will cost a large amount of money per user on
an ongoing basis (maintenance costs are not cheap). Typical
certificate authority software is $100,000 USD and up, smart cards
and readers will cost around $50 USD and up per user, and there are
significant administrative costs. If setup and maintained correctly
however a digital certificate based authentication scheme can be
significantly more secure then username and password based methods,
as well as offering advantages in tracking and auditing user
activity.
</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.5 Network database server</STRONG></P>
<P>One method that is quite effective, but often ignored is the use
of a database to store user credentials. Most moderns databases
support ODBC connectivity, making access via CGI scripts and so on
very easy. Database's also lend themselves to ease of administration
and management, especially with large numbers of users, additionally
you can typically tie other user information in, such as HR would
keep on employees. One major issue however is the security of data
moving to and from the database, in most cases it will not be
protected so you should use a VPN solution (such as IPSec) to protect
it or use SSL to encrypt it (with a utility such as sslwrap or
stunnel). One advantage of using a database is that languages such as
Perl support persistent database connections, so if you use mod_perl
or fast CGI you can get extremely high performance out of a CGI and a
good database.</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.6 Radius</STRONG></P>
<P>Radius is a very popular protocol for authenticating users for
dial-in and a variety of other network services. Tying your www based
authentication into an existing system like Radius can save a lot of
money (especially in administrative costs). There are Perl modules
for Radius (actually there are Perl modules for just about
everything), making integration relatively simple. Radius does
encrypt the password before sending it to the server typically,
however you may wish to use some sort of VPN (I recommend IPSec) to
properly protect the entire transaction (and prevent someone from
pretending to be the Radius server for example).</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.7 TACACS/TACACS+</STRONG></P>
<P>TACACS, and the newer TACACS+ are Cisco's authentication protocol
for allowing users access to terminals servers and routers. Just as
with Radius, tying your www authentication into an existing system
can save a significant amount of money and administrative overhead.
Perl has modules for TACACS/TACACS+ allowing you to authenticate
users easily, one minor caveat, as with Radius the protection on the
username and password is less then optimal, I would advise using a
VPN (I recommend IPSec) to properly protect the entire transaction
(and prevent someone from pretending to be the TACACS/TACACS+ server
for example).</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.8 Novell</STRONG></P>
<P>Novell has been making directory service products for a long time,
and has recently started to shift from being Novell centric to
service centric. By this I mean that Novell has ported NDS (now
available in a &quot;full strength&quot; and a &quot;lite&quot;
version) to various platforms, including Linux and FreeBSD. This
allows you to store a considerable number of users efficiently, it
ties in well with any existing Novell infrastructure, and can of
course be used as the backbone of your corporate authentication
system. NDS is quite mature and allows for many objects (Novell says
they tested it to 10 billion in their laboratory), and is now
platform independent. Current version of NDS support an LDAP
interface so tying support for your CGI programs into NDS is
relatively easy. See the LDAP section for more details.</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.8.1 NDS eDirectory, formerly Corporate Edition</STRONG></P>
<P>This is a &quot;full strength&quot; NDS suitable for corporate
environments.</P>

</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.8.2 NDS Authentication Services</STRONG></P>
<P>This is NDS &quot;lite&quot;, suitable for www authentication and
storing data on users.</P>

package.

<P><STRONG>4.2.9 ADS</STRONG></P>
<P>ADS (Active Directory Services) is Microsoft's answer to NDS, and
ships with Windows 2000. ADS is a newcomer, but chances are many
organizations will deploy it so chances are you will need to use it
for web based authentication at some point. Like NDS, ADS supports
and LDAP interface, making programming support for it relatively
simple. See the LDAP section for more details.</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.10 DCE</STRONG></P>
<P>DCE (Distributed Computing Environment) allows you to access
applications and files by name without having to know their location
via RPC (Remote Procedure Call, the same system used for NIS and so
on). Generally speaking a DCE based web authentication solution will
only be of interest to people with an existing DCE infrastructure.
There is a set of Perl modules, and Apache modules to provide DCE
capabilities and access to DFS (Distributed Filesystem) available for
free at:</P>

</P>
<P><STRONG>4.2.11 WebSEAL</STRONG></P>
<P>WebSEAL appears to be a framework for building authentication
solutions using pretty much anything (PKI, username and passwords,
etc.). It is capable of using DCE, Kerberos 5, SSL Entrust and a
variety of other protocols and encryption methods. IBM is currently
in the process of acquiring DASCOM.</P>

<P><STRONG>4.2.12 Kerberos</STRONG></P>
<P>Kerberos is a strong authentication framework available for most
UNIX platforms and there are some Windows clients. Most modern BSD
and Linux distributions for example ship with support for Kerberos
clients and servers. With some effort you can also integrate UNIX
Kerberos and Windows 2000 Kerberos making for a homogenous
authentication environment.</P>
