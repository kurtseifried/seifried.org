<p>A variety of authentication methods and technologies exist.
They all boil down to either something you know, something you
have, or something you are. This &quot;something&quot; has to be
unique, and either secret (like a password), or sufficiently
complex to be unforgeable (such as a retina). You must also have
some mechanism for securely transmitting the data, otherwise
someone might be able to copy your password, or replay the
authentication packets to gain access, this is usually
accomplished via SSL (which uses public key cryptography. </p>
<p><strong>3.1 Something you know</strong></p>
<p>This is the most common since the storage mechanism used is
your own memory, making it one of the cheapest forms of storage.
It is easy to manage, easy to deploy, and most systems support it
out of the box. The downside is however it is relatively
insecure, users choose bad passwords, passwords get stored in
form fields, etc.</p>
<p><strong>3.1.1 Username and password</strong></p>
<p>Typically it consists of a username and password, both 5 to 8
characters long (although hopefully the password is longer). This
data is relatively easy to store and is typically kept in a flat
text file (such as /etc/passwd) in the form
username:hashed_password, where the password is hashed so that
you cannot simply read and use it. Typical hashes used are crypt
(old and easily brute forced, but with a good password relatively
safe) and MD5 (much better hash, somewhat more overhead required.
When a username and password need to be checked the system goes
down the list till it finds a matching name, and then hashes the
password that was supplied and compares it to the listed value,
if they match then that means the username and password supplied
were correct. </p>
<p><strong>3.2 Something you have</strong></p>
<p>One problem with the &quot;something you know&quot; model is
that the secret cannot be very large, and you must input it into
the computer manually each time you wish to use it. If that
computer were to be compromised then it would be a simple matter
of logging keystrokes or otherwise gleaning your password.
Digital certificates are a growing technology because not only
can they be used to prove identity, but to secure transactions
(typically using SSL). Alternatively there are cryptocards,
credit card sized tokens with preloaded secrets that you use a
PIN number to access and are used to respond to a challenge by
the server.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.1 X.509 certificates on the client machine</strong></p>
<p>This is a really bad idea (it's so bad in fact I decided to
put this at the very beginning of the explanation). You can
easily generate an X.509 certificate, take the file and load it
into a client machine (typically the mail program or www program
can make use of it). This however makes the assumption that only
one person will be using the workstation, and that the machine
cannot be misused by others. This is really only useful on a home
PC (that is secure), or if you lock your office door and never
let anyone in and have a secured PC. In a business environment
the certificates could be useful as identification of the machine
(but not as identification of the user), in Internet Explorer for
example you can mark the private key non-exportable, meaning to
copy the certificate off the client workstation and put it on
another will slow down most attackers. In other words digital
certificates loaded onto client machines are useless, in fact
they are worse then useless because they are usually not
protected (i.e. with a passphrase) so you can easily impersonate
the person. </p>
<p><strong>3.2.2 X.509 certificates on smartcards</strong></p>
<p>This is a much more secure method of generating and storing
certificates, as well as being far more portable. The main
problem currently with smartcards is the lack of smartcard
readers on computers (and even if they have a smartcard reader
there is a good chance it might not be compatible). There are
also a wide variety of smartcards, ranging from ones that simply
store data (and are not secure) to ones with built in random
number generators, encryption chips, storage, and have been built
to be tamper resistant (these cards cost $25 USD each typically).
An additional benefit of these cards is you can use them for
logging in to a wide variety of services (Windows 2000 has
smartcard support for logins), and are quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Smartcards cannot typically be &quot;copied&quot;, the private
key is stored on a portion of the card that should not be
accessible. When encryption or decryption takes place the card
does the work internally using the private key, it is not
feasible to remove (or copy) the private key from most good smart
cards. However this is not to say that you cannot create
identical cards. Several companies offer this service,
essentially they use a secured computer to create the private and
public key, these keys are then loaded onto one or more cards and
the computer is wiped clean so that the private key cannot be
recovered. This is especially useful for companies if you want to
issue several people the same smart card, or maintain a backup of
smartcards. This last point is especially important, as cards can
be lost, damaged or stolen, if you only have one copy of a card
then any data that was encrypted is no longer available (unless
of course you have cleartext copies or backups). </p>
<p><strong>3.2.3 Challenge response token</strong></p>
<p>These are far more secure then an old style username and
password. Each time you try to log into the server a challenge is
issued (say an 8 digit number), you enter it into your token
where it gets mangled via 3DES and spits out a new 8 digit
number. To create this number you need the secret that is loaded
onto the key, and kept on the server (and it's usually a large
number), meaning an attacker stands very little chance of
guessing it. These tokens are easy to use (hit &quot;on&quot;,
enter your pin, enter the challenge), and generally secure (enter
the PIN wrong X times and the card wipes itself). They do tend to
be expensive however, selling for around $60 USD and as low as
$40 USD in bulk. There are also additional costs in setting up
the tokens, recovering them from employees that leave, and so on.
An additional benefit of cryptocards is you can use them for
logging in to a wide variety of services (Novell has cryptocard
support for logins), and are quite easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Something you are</strong></p>
<p>Personally speaking I don't like biometrics all that much, and
for one very simple reason. What happens when an attacker manages
to crack the system open (i.e. finds out how to &quot;spoof&quot;
a finger or eyeball)? You have to replace the existing biometric
system with a new one that will not be fooled by that attack, an
extremely expensive, but more importantly a very lengthy process,
leaving you open to attack. Unlike password based and token based
systems you cannot simply issue people a new fingerprint. I have
seen a variety of fingerprint scanning devices fooled, if you
have rolled out 4000 fingerprint scanners to provide logins for
users at their workstation what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>3.3.1 Fingerprint scanners</strong></p>
<p>Fingerprint scanners are getting quite affordable (I have seen
them around $50 USD), easy to use, and are relatively
non-intrusive. Older fingerprint scanners tend to be optical, I
would avoid these as they are the easiest to fool. The next step
up are the laser based ones that actually measure the ridges and
patterns of your fingerprint, you also don't have to worry about
the glass getting dirty (and an attacker would need to create a 3
dimensional model with a pulse to fool it). This authentication
method would only be of use for corporate LAN's, as the chance of
finding a public terminal with a fingerprint scanner are slim
indeed. </p>
<p><strong>3.3.2 Retinal scanners</strong></p>
<p>Retinal scanners are still pretty expensive, and probably
overkill for www based authentication. There is also a degree of
resistance to them, people believe that somehow they might damage
their eyes, generally speaking they cannot, but there is
something a bit intimidating about sticking your eye in close to
a machine. This authentication method would only be of use for
corporate LAN's, as the chance of finding a public terminal with
a fingerprint scanner are very slim indeed. </p>
