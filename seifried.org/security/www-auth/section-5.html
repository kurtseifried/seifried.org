<p>Authenticating users varies in difficulty, but is only the
first step for many web based projects that require user
authentication. Chances are the user's interaction with the
system will involve more then one transaction (i.e. they will
&quot;login&quot; to the system, check their email, maybe post a
message to a board, and then ask for some protected information).
You do not want the user to have to authenticate each time they
try to access something, you want them to authenticate at the
beginning of the session, and once the session is over you want
them to re-authenticate the next time they access the system. So
you need some way to keep track of the individual user (simply
using the IP they come from or similar methods is not enough),
and you need some way of keeping track of the session (once they
get up and leave their computer you do not want someone else to
be able to use their credentials). </p>
<p><strong>5.1 Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are a method of storing data on the users computer,
the server creates the cookies, and send it to the browser.
Cookies can be permanent (stored on the users hard drive,
sometimes with no expiry date) or session cookies (stored in
memory, gone once the browser is closed). There are some problems
with cookies however, many security conscious users will disable
them, or delete them periodically (a variety of software to
manage cookies stored on your machine exists).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html</a></p>
<p>There are some tools available to view and modify cookies on
the client end. Once of these is HTTPClient which is a java http
client library with many features, including the ability to view
cookies (both session and stored). It is available under the LGPL
license.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/">http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/</a>
</p>
<p><strong>5.1.1 Stored cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies can be stored on the users harddrive, allowing them to
be persistent (assuming they don't get deleted). This is
typically used by organizations with a low security requirement,
and is typically used more for tracking users then actual
authentication (although some sites like Hotmail, Microsoft MCP
site, etc. use it for authentication). Generally speaking this
method is a bad idea since anyone with access to the computer can
simply go to the website and be automatically authenticated, as
well the cookies could be copied off of the system and used on
another system to gain access. If you have any sort of real
security requirement then I would advise against using these. If
however you simply want to authenticate users for tracking people
(like many online newspapers) then they are acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>5.1.2 Session cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies can also be stored in memory for the length of the
session (i.e. until the users turns the www browser off). This is
much safer then storing them on the users harddrive, and you
still retain all the capabilities of cookies. Simply authenticate
the user and create a cookie that is unique, and give it to them.
Store that cookies unique data on the server (in a flat text file
or database, if you use a networked database multiple servers can
accept an authenticated user, allowing you to do easy load
balancing), and simply request the cookie from the user each time
they attempt to do a transaction that requires authentication. By
storing the cookie data, time it was issued, and last time it was
used you can easily enforce a session limit (of say 30 minutes),
and an inactivity timeout (of say 5 minutes) which greatly
decreases the likelihood of someone using that persons
credentials (because they left for lunch and forgot to turn their
web browser off). You can also add a &quot;logout&quot; function
that flushes the cookie data from the server (although training
users to do this can be difficult). Several web servers include
software modules to assist in this (so you don't need to
completely reinvent the wheel).</p>
<p><strong>5.2 X.509 certificates</strong></p>
<p>By their very nature X.509 certificates usually contain data
on the owner (the public key and data are typically signed by a
third party, such as Verisign or Thawte). If you trust the
singing party (i.e. it might be your internal Certificate
Authority) then you can use the information contained with the
certificate as the users identifier and simply have them
authenticate for each transaction (for smartcards however this
may require them to type a password in each time, but if the
certificate is stored on the machine (BAD IDEA) then you can
simply access it). Generally speaking if you are using smartcards
you will probably want to use some other method for keeping track
of the user (such as cookies or URL). </p>
<p><strong>5.3 HTTP header based authentication (HTTP auth)</strong></p>
<p>Using HTTP authentication (i.e. http header based
authentication) generally saves the data used during the session
so the user is not required to constantly login in every time
they view a page. These are accessible as environmental variables
to the CGI script typically, so are very easy to use for other
types of authentication. You can easily use HTTP based header
authentication across multiple servers (the data source is
typically a text file or a database file). HTTP header
authentication data is cached in the browser session so the user
isn't constantly required to reauthenticate, however this means
that if the users then leaves the browser running (even if they
go to another site) someone else could go back to the site, and
would be authenticated (since the credentials are stored in
memory). MSIE can also permanently store the username and
password, many users will be tempted to do this (which makes
their life easier). You can disable this in the browser, and
there are tags you can place in the webpage to prevent it, see
section 6.1.2. Since HTTP is stateless the server has no idea
whether you have &quot;left&quot; the site or not, you might
browse a site, leave your browser open for 5 days, then go back
to the site, your username and password would be automatically
sent. This is especially dangerous if you access the site from an
Internet kiosk, in many cases you cannot shutdown the browser
running on these systems. Also because the authentication happens
at the webserver level and not a CGI it is harder to track what
is going on without monitoring log files or some other solution.
For high security applications, or applications that will be used
by non-savvy computer users some timeout method should be
combined with the authentication to log out &quot;stale&quot;
sessions.</p>
<p><strong>5.4 Unique URL's</strong></p>
<p>One effective method to track users that is completely browser
independent (i.e. all browsers support it no matter what) is to
use unique URL's. </p>
<p><strong>5.4.1 Appending data to the URL</strong></p>
<p>Simple tag on a unique string of data to the URL, and store
that string in a database along with the time it was issued and
last used (basically similar in concept to cookies). This is a
somewhat trickier method, but it is supported by all web browsers
which is a definite advantage. One site that makes heavy usage of
this is www.sun.com, go to it and click any button, you will end
up with a URL like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>http://www.sun.com/products-n-solutions/;$sessionid$ONWF1PQACGLERAMUVFZE3NQ</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>which is probably unique (I haven't actually bothered to
analyze it). Simply store the string in a database and you can
enforce maximum session length, and idle timeouts. You can also
add a &quot;logout&quot; function that flushes the unique data
from the server (although training users to do this can be
difficult). Several web servers include software modules to
assist in this (so you don't need to completely reinvent the
wheel).</p>
<p><strong>5.4.2 DNS names</strong></p>
<p>Another technique is to use a unique DNS names. Simply use a
wild card for the DNS domain, for example with Bind:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>*.www-server.example.org	IN	A	10.1.2.3</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Any DNS request (such as
nsjw73judnhsi8u.www-server.example.org or
45.www-server.example.org) will end up at the IP 127.0.0.1. You
would of course need to configure your web server appropriately,
either making the default site the one used, or use a modified
web server that accepts *.www-server.example.org and serves it a
specific site (i.e. co-hosting multiple sites using this
technique is potentially difficult). You can then have the web
server hand the DNS name to the script or you can query the web
client for the appropriate environmental variable. As always an
attacker can easily modify this data, so do not trust it
implicitly. </p>
<p><strong>5.5 HTTP_REFERRER</strong></p>
<p>Another method of tracking a user is to use the HTTP_REFERRER
environmental variable once they have authenticated. I have only
seen a few sites doing this, but it is effective, simply specify
that the user must come from a certain page (like login.html).
This method is somewhat useful if you use &quot;unique&quot;
URL's, however if the URL are pretty standard it is really only
useful for restricting a set of pages to certain users, and not
very helpful for tracking actual individual users. Since you need
to do CGI programming and use &quot;unique&quot; URL's to make
use of this technique you may as well store the data in a
database and access it there. </p>
<p><strong>5.6 Hidden form fields and other HTML code</strong></p>
<p>Another method that is universally supported by browsers and
requires no special configuration is the use of hidden form
fields. The major problem with this is the caching of webpages
(although you can set HTTP headers that tell the browser not to
cache). It is similar in concept to using cookies, you can hand
the user some information that you can later retrieve, using
hidden form fields (this is the technique my ISP uses to view
your configuration webpages for email and so forth). Simply hand
back a unique string, store it in a database, and you can enforce
a maximum session, and/or an idle timeout (so you don't have to
worry as much about someone using the client when the user walks
away). You can also add a &quot;logout&quot; function that
flushes the unique data from the server (although training users
to do this can be difficult).</p>
