<p>Because HTTP and HTTPS are stateless protocols, the server has
no idea if you rebooted your computer and continued browsing, got
shunted through a different proxy server, and so on. Keeping
track of users is very difficult, using IP addresses does not
work since a users IP may change during the session, or many
users may come from one IP (i.e. AOL has large proxy servers).
Most tracking methods involve handing back the user a unique
piece of data, this can take the form of a cookie, URL or hidden
form field to name a few. One important thing to remember is that
users can (and will) modify the data you give to them, URL's and
cookies are trivial to edit, HTML pages can be created with
modified HTML. There have been in fact numerous security holes
related to programmers implicitly trusting the data the user
hands back to them. Do not do this.</p>
<p>The &quot;best&quot; method is to create a unique token for
each session (i.e. a hash of the time, date, remote user IP,
whatever), and encrypt the data (i.e. take the resulting hash and
then use 3DES to encrypt it with a secret) it is almost
impossible for an attacker to recreate someone else's token and
possibly &quot;hijack&quot; their session or otherwise gain
unauthorized access. If you use a hash of the data you will need
to keep a copy locally with the time, since any timestamp will be
reduced to a random series of letters. Using a timestamp alone is
not safe since an attacker can simply make a copy of it and use
it, you should also use identifying data such as IP address (not
always reliable) browser type, and so on (basically an internal
state table, a database backend can be used of course to store
this data). If you know when it was issued, you can include usage
rules (token expires after 10 minutes of non use, every time they
use it that gets reset, or whatever), and you simply request the
token each time they access the site. Users also cannot modify
the token without &quot;breaking&quot; it if it is securely
encrypted, nor can they glean what exactly it is you are handing
them.</p>
<p><strong>6.1 Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies, as mentioned in section 5.1, can be used to store
unique pieces of information on a users computer. It is trivial
to edit cookies, i.e. go into C:\Windows\Cookies\ with notepad
and edit them. Additionally many users do not allow permanent
cookies, or use cookie management software to periodically delete
them. However using session cookies is relatively safe, although
modifying them client side is of course possible, but the
advantage is that most web browsers allow them and they are
&quot;invisible&quot; to users. </p>
<p><strong>6.2 Unique URLs</strong></p>
<p>Unique URL's, as mentioned in section 5.4, can be used to
uniquely identify sessions. It is extremely trivial for an
attacker to modify the URL, also these URL's can
&quot;leak&quot;, to proxy servers and so on. They should only be
used with extreme caution. </p>
<p><strong>6.3 Hidden form fields and other HTML code</strong></p>
<p>Hidden form fields and other HTML code, as mentioned in
section 5.6, can be used to uniquely identify sessions. It is
relatively easy for an attacker to find the HTML (i.e. view
source) and edit the data contained within it, so do not use
things like &quot;admin=yes&quot; (don't laugh, one popular CGI
did do this). </p>
