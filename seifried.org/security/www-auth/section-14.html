<p>This section has been added since many people use databases to
store the login and password information that is used to
authenticate. Doing this securely is much more difficult then
most people realize. </p>
<p><strong>14.1 Basic security considerations</strong></p>
<p>The authentication backend must be secured heavily of course,
there are several &quot;best practices&quot; you should follow:</p>
<p>The authentication server should only be an authentication
server, it should not have other services such as DNS, WWW, POP,
IMAP and so forth. Any additional services only increase the
chances of a compromise.</p>
<p>The authentication server should have a minimal number of
users that are allowed to log in, the best is to only allow
administrators as needed.</p>
<p>The authentication server should be firewalled and possibly
placed on a separate segment. </p>
<p>If this is a publicly accessible web server using the
authentication server then you may want to place the
authentication server outside of your internal network. This
prevents attackers from potentially compromising an internal
machine (using an SQL insertion attack for example). </p>
<p>Where possible create a special user that only has read access
to the database that is used for authentication queries. In this
manner it is much harder for an attacker to modify data in the
database. </p>
<p><strong>14.2 Exporting authentication information</strong></p>
<p>As it is preferable to have authentication servers isolated as
much as possible it is not often that people allow externally
placed authentication servers to pull data from internal
authentication servers. The most popular solution is to export
data from the internal servers, this also allows you to only
export the accounts that are needed instead of everything.
Exporting information depends heavily on the exist authentication
backend used.</p>
<p><strong>14.2.1 Databases</strong></p>
<p>Typically the simplest was is to simply export a subset of the
data to a file and then upload it to authentication server where
it is imported to the appropriate table(s). Another method would
be to use an automated SQL client to connect to the external
authentication server and update accounts with standard SQL
commands (i.e. INSERT records for new accounts). This can be
combined with database triggers (not available in all databases)
so that whenever a password is modified for example the internal
server connects to the external one and updates the information.
The last method is to use database replication (again not
available in all databases) and simply replicate the database out
to the external server. Depending on the product in use you may
be able to filter what goes out. </p>
<p><strong>14.2.2 Windows 2000</strong></p>
<p>Using the LDAP server in Windows 2000 you can replicate data
to other LDAP servers, allowing for relatively easy updates to an
external server. </p>
<p><strong>14.3 SQL insertion attacks</strong></p>
<p>As always you need to filter data that is provided by users.
Just blindly using the contents of the &quot;name&quot; field can
be very dangerous. Inserting special characters can allow an
attacker to modify the SQL command used, such as inserting
wildcard characters (i.e. set username and password to
&quot;*&quot; so that it simply matches the first record).
Several papers are available on this topic:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roses-labs.com">http://www.roses-labs.com</a>
- Abusing poor programming techniques in webserver scripts V 1.0</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitaloffense.net/csw/slides/CanSec_files/frame.htm">http://www.digitaloffense.net/csw/slides/CanSec_files/frame.htm</a>
- Making NT Server Bleed </p>
<p>To combat SQL insertion attacks you should sanitize data
before it is sent to the database server. This must not be done
client side through the use of java script for example since it
is trivial for attackers to circumvent preventive measures that
run on their machines. Probably the best piece of advice is to
create a list of allowed characters (i.e. a-z, A-Z, 0-9) for
usernames and the appropriate characters for passwords, not
allowing &quot;special&quot; characters like &quot;/&quot;,
&quot;\&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot; and so forth will
greatly reduce the number of potential problems. You should then
escape any remaining &quot;special&quot; characters so they are
interpreted as data and not parts of the SQL command. For Perl
there is a DBI quote function, for recent version of PHP this is
done automatically for example. </p>
<p><strong>14.4 Preventing brute forcing </strong></p>
<p>As with any authentication system attackers can (and will) try
to brute force their way in by using different usernames and
passwords. Preventing brute forcing is difficult, for example
using account lockouts results in a new problem, attackers simply
try to guess the password X number of times and then the account
is locked out and users cannot access the system. Using rate
limits and back off procedures is typically more robust,
increasing the time between authentication methods by 5 seconds
will force an attacker to connect repeatedly, increasing the time
needed to try passwords. With all of these solutions there is one
major common flaw. The assumption is that attackers will choose a
user and then try various passwords. Attackers can just as easily
choose a password and try different usernames. This works
especially well with systems that use default passwords when
accounts are created or reset for example (for example my
telephone company and my bank use default passwords, the phone
company changes it every year, and the bank four times a year).
If you use some sort of lockout or backoff you should take this
into consideration. </p>
