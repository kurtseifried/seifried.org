<p>Another option is to move some of the authentication mechanism
to the client side (although I am not sure why you would want to
do this). A variety of languages exist that allow you to write
applications that run on the client side. One option would be to
write a client side application that behaves like a hardware
token, that is a user inputs a secret to activate it, and then
you can use challenge response authentication. The problem with
this is that the users secret would be shipped to the client
machine (which is potentially hostile), and they would be
inputting their password into it as well (so if the machine were
running a keyboard sniffer/etc it would then have all the info it
needs to impersonate the user). </p>
<p><strong>11.1 Java</strong></p>
<p>Java is supported on most platforms and browsers, however not
all support it properly, and in many cases users will have
disabled it (so relying on it might not always work). Java is an
excellent option if you control the client side, or can encourage
the availability of Java (or are willing to take the chance it
might not be available, which is an increasingly minor problem). </p>
<p><strong>11.1.1 Hushmail</strong></p>
<p>One example of this technology in usage is at Hushmail,
Hushmail provides free, secure, web based email. You generate a
public / private key pair when you sign up for an account with
them, and the private key is protected by a passphrase. When you
log in to the service a Java applet is downloaded to your PC and
this program accepts your passphrase and so on which is partially
used to help validate your account, at which point your public
and private key are downloaded to the client. Generally speaking
this is about as secure as you can make email and still have
people accessing it from PC's not under their control. One
security concern, over which Hushmail and the user can have
little to no control in cases is the possibility of a keyboard
sniffer logging the users passphrase for their Hushmail account /
private key.</p>

<p><strong>11.1.2 Guardbot</strong></p>
<p>Another possibility is Guardbot, which password protects www
pages. Essentially there are two components, an applet that
encrypts the data, using DES (56 bit keyspace), and an applet
that will decrypt the data with the password you provide. The
advantage of this over traditional server based methods of
control (such as htaccess in Apache) is that the user manages it
fully, and can protect each file individually without much setup.
To fully take advantage of the keyspace available your password
must contain upper and lower case letters, numbers (and
punctuation marks, but this can confuse users) of around 10
letters, however since people tend to choose less then random
passwords a longer password then this is advisable.</p>

<p><strong>11.2 ActiveX</strong></p>
<p>ActiveX is only supported on Windows platforms running
Internet Explorer (it will not work with Netscape) so choosing
ActiveX severely limits your browser and OS options. </p>
<p><strong>11.2.1 InnerDynamics</strong></p>
<p>InnerDynamics makes a variety of Java and ActiveX components
that include encryption:</p>
