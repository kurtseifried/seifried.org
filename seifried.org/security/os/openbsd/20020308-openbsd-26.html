<p>Well it's been a few months, and a new release of OpenBSD is
out (since December 1st 1999 actually) and I thought it was high
time I covered some of the new features and improvements. For
those of you unfamiliar with OpenBSD it is a flavor of UNIX based
on BSD, with one main goal in mind. Security. The entire purpose
of OpenBSD is to provide a fast, stable, and above all, secure
computing platform. </p>
<h5>OpenSSH</h5>
<p>The most noticeable change in OpenBSD 2.6 is probably the
addition of OpenSSH. OpenSSH is SSH with all the proprietary
components ripped out, a lot of bug fixes, and the encryption is
all done externally via OpenSSL. OpenSSH ships with 2.6 and is
part of the default install, but due to the RSA patent in the US
the OpenSSL components are not available on the CD-ROM, so you
will need to download this from an OpenBSD ftp site (they could
have included OpenSSL on the CD-ROM, but then they would need to
produce one for the US, and one for international use, and there
would be other possible legal problems as well, so they opted not
to). During the install however you will be prompted to install
it, first which version (US or international) and then for the
method (FTP, HTTP, CDROM, etc), and then for the location. You
can of course install it later on with:</p>
<pre>#pkg_add -v ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.6/packages/i386/ssl26.tar.gz</pre>
<p>or if you are in the USA:</p>
<pre>#pkg_add -v ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.6/packages/i386/sslUSA26.tar.gz</pre>
<p>By default OpenSSH is enabled, so as soon as you install the
SSL package and reboot it will work. SKey support is also
available now for OpenSSH.</p>
<p><strong>Why OpenSSH matters:</strong></p>
<p>OpenBSD is the first Open Source operating system to ship
something like ssh that is not encumbered by licensing issues
(although there are patent issues, you can use RSAREF in the US).
This means people can easily login to and administer OpenBSD
systems in a secure manner with very little additional setup
required (as compared to say, deploying IPSec). </p>
<h5>Apache</h5>
<p>Another improvement is the use of DSO's (Dynamic Shared
Object's) in Apache, which is a very similar concept to shared
libraries typical of UNIX platforms. DSO's allow you to add in
support for third party software (such as SSL) without having to
recompile the Apache software. This allows for a much greater
degree of flexibility, not only in adding support for new things,
but upgrading them (instead of recompiling all of Apache you
compile a now DSO and restart Apache). The primary disadvantage
of DSO's is that some platforms do not support them properly, and
on some supported platforms DSO's will slow the server down a
bit. Generally speaking however the gains made in ease of use,
deployment of software, and so on outweigh any minor performance
problems. </p>
<p><strong>Why DSO matters:</strong></p>
<p>It makes the deployment of a secure web server far easier (and
other features like perl_mod). Also if there is a bug in one of
the DSO's you only need to replace it and restart Apache (as
opposed to recompiling everything).</p>
<h5>Driver updates</h5>
<p>This goes without saying as a good thing. OpenBSD has
historically lagged behind systems like Linux and Windows for
driver support, which is a good thing in my opinion. Linux and
Windows support a lot of BAD hardware (i.e. estimates run as high
as 70% that NT crashes are due to bad drivers and software
problems), OpenBSD tends to support the better quality hardware,
because that is what the developers want. However OpenBSD has
also lacked support for some very popular hardware (especially in
the area of sound cards), so with the release of 2.6 a lot of
drivers have been added, and others improved.</p>
<p><strong>Why better drivers matter:</strong></p>
<p>Bad drivers can cause crashes and other stability problems. I
also want to use the soundcard on my new Sony VAIO laptop.</p>
<h5>Secure by default</h5>
<p>Well I lied a bit on this one, OpenBSD has been &quot;secure
by default&quot; for a while. What does this mean? Well a default
install of OpenBSD should (in theory) be completely secure
against network attacks. The only services turned on by default
are OpenSSH, portmap, and some services in inetd, all of which
have been audited extensively and are relatively risk free. The
OpenBSD philosophy (as I understand it) is to make the system as
secure as possible, which would mean in most operating systems
disabling damn near everything. But in the case of OpenBSD this
is not necessary, the services that are on by default have been
heavily audited, and deemed &quot;safe&quot;, and as such are
enabled (plus they give a basic level of functionality required
by many people). If a user wants to do something
&quot;insecure&quot; (like say install an IMAP server) they are
on their own, you will need to get the ports collection, compile
and install an IMAP server, and then add configuration lines in
inetd.conf for it. If you want to do something deemed
&quot;safe&quot;, such as install the OpenBSD ftp daemon all you
need to do is uncomment the line for it in inetd.conf, and add an
ftp user (this is covered in the OpenBSD FAQ).</p>
<p><strong>Why &quot;secure by default matters&quot;:</strong></p>
<p>You can install OpenBSD and be reasonably confident there are
no exploitable holes. You can enable certain things (like FTP, or
DNS) with a high level of confidence that it won't bite you later
on (in the form of someone remotely exploiting it and getting
root on your box). If you want to do &quot;insecure&quot; things,
you will be forced to learn a little bit about how to do it
(correctly or otherwise). </p>
