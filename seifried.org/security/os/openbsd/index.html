<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Well it's been a few months, and a new
release of OpenBSD is out (since December 1st 1999 actually)
and I thought it was high time I covered some of the new
features and improvements. For those of you unfamiliar with
OpenBSD it is a flavor of UNIX based on BSD, with one main
goal in mind. Security. The entire purpose of OpenBSD is to
provide a fast, stable, and above all, secure computing
platform. </font></p>

alternative</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">So you want to build a firewall, but aren't
quite sure what to use? You might want to consider OpenBSD,
an secure offshoot of the BSD family. From the beginning
OpenBSD's entire purpose has been to be a secure operating
system. In order to achieve this, the OpenBSD founder (Theo
de Raadt) started a code audit project, pretty much every
single line of code in OpenBSD has been checked, and many
problems were found, and fixed. In addition to this OpenBSD
is based out of Canada, which allows for the inclusion of
strong cryptography software with the OS. One prime example
is the planned addition of OpenSSH, based off of SSH 1.2.12,
in the next release of OpenBSD (2.7, this winter or so).
OpenBSD also has a slightly better network stack then Linux
(at least 2.2.x Linux), applications such as Network Flight
Recorder, which take large volumes of data off of the network
simply do not work well under most operating systems. Many of
the commercial IDS systems use OpenBSD as their OS of choice.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This isn't a totally conventional article.
I'm not going to be recommending you replace every UNIX
server you've got with OpenBSD.&nbsp; Although the OpenBSD
team did release 2.7 just last week, making it very hard not
to cover its new features, this article will be a bit of
both.&nbsp;</font></p>
