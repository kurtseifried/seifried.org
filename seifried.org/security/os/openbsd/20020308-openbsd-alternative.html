<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you want to build a firewall, but aren't quite sure what to
use? You might want to consider OpenBSD, an secure offshoot of
the BSD family. From the beginning OpenBSD's entire purpose has
been to be a secure operating system. In order to achieve this,
the OpenBSD founder (Theo de Raadt) started a code audit project,
pretty much every single line of code in OpenBSD has been
checked, and many problems were found, and fixed. In addition to
this OpenBSD is based out of Canada, which allows for the
inclusion of strong cryptography software with the OS. One prime
example is the planned addition of OpenSSH, based off of SSH
1.2.12, in the next release of OpenBSD (2.7, this winter or so).
OpenBSD also has a slightly better network stack then Linux (at
least 2.2.x Linux), applications such as Network Flight Recorder,
which take large volumes of data off of the network simply do not
work well under most operating systems. Many of the commercial
IDS systems use OpenBSD as their OS of choice.</p>
<p><b>Getting started</b></p>
<p>You can buy OpenBSD on CDROM, and this is probably a good
choice for several reasons. One you are getting the OS on trusted
media, you can verify the package signatures, and be sure that
nothing strange has been done to the software. You also do not
need to download OpenBSD, which depending on your network
connection can be tricky (I'm lucky, my ISP has a 10 meg peer
link to the UofA which hosts ftp.openbsd.org). Also by buying the
OpenBSD CD's you are supporting their effort, which is a nice
thing to do. Once you have OpenBSD you can boot off the CD, or
create a bootable floppy disk and use this. Simply write the file
image &quot;floppy25.fs&quot; onto a floppy disk using dd under
Linux/etc:</p>
<pre>dd if=floppy25.fs of=/dev/fd0</pre>
<p>Or under Windows use &quot;rawrite.exe&quot;, or
&quot;ntrw.exe&quot; under NT (NT complains loudly if you use
rawrite.exe). These are available in the &quot;tools&quot;
directory (please see links at the bottom of the page).</p>
<p><b>Installation</b></p>
<p>I'm going to assume we're installing on an Intel based PC,
however OpenBSD supports a variety of architectures such as
PowerPC, Alpha and Sparc among others if you want to use
something more &quot;exotic&quot;. For first time installers I
would recommend giving up an entire harddrive to OpenBSD, this
simplifies matters considerably. Simply boot off of the CDROM or
floppy disk, choose Install, when it asks you which harddrive to
use (for example on a machine with one IDE HD it will offer
&quot;wd0&quot;), choose your harddrive, and answer
&quot;yes&quot; to using the entire drive. You will then be
dumped into the label editor, a somewhat traumatic experience if
you've never used one before. The portion of the harddrive you
want to use with OpenBSD will be in the &quot;c&quot; portion,
and within that portion you will create the partitions you want.
Minimally you will need one partition for data (/) and one for
swap. Use &quot;d&quot; to delete existing portions if you want
to clear the HD up a bit, and then create partitions with
&quot;a&quot;, you should end up with something like:</p>
<pre>16 partitions:
#	size	offset	fstype	[fsize	bsize	cpg]
  a:  8200000	    63	4.2BSD	  1024	 8192	  6
  b:   221777    8200063	  swap
  c:  8421840	     0	unused	     0       0</pre>
<p>Blocks are measured in 512 byte blocks, not 1024 byte blocks,
so if your HD appears twice as large as normal, this is why (my
example is a Western Digital Caviar 24300). Then hit q to quit
and save changes. You probably don't want to edit the disk labels
by hand using ed, so say no, and then yes to &quot;Are you really
sure that you're ready to proceed?&quot;, at this point the
partitions will be formatted.</p>
<p>Configuring the network is a straightforward process, you
assign it a hostname and so on, and then configure the individual
interfaces. If you want to use dhcp on an interface, you can, or
you can set them statically, following this you set the default
gateway and nameservers, if one of your interfaces uses dhcp and
is assigned this OpenBSD will &quot;suggest&quot; these, making
life simple. The next step is to set the root password, the
standard &quot;choose a good password&quot; lecture applies here
of course.</p>
<p>You then get to choose what to install from, my preferred
method is ftp, however you can also install from http, tae,
CDROM, NFS or a local harddrive. If you choose ftp you will be
asked for a proxy/etc (you don't need to use on of course), and
then whether to use active ftp or not (this is nice since many
firewalls and ftp servers do strange things). You can as for a
list of potential servers, simply choose one &quot;close&quot; to
you, of you can use your own server (what I do), and you can then
login anonymously or with an account. The install then logs into
the FTP server and gets a list of available packages you can
install. I would recommend installing misc25.tar.gz,
comp25.tar.gz, and man25.tar.gz if this is your first install,
the man pages will really help, and the ability to compile
software (like ssh, which will be included in 2.6) is nice. I
wouldn't bother to install X on a machine destined to be a
firewall. After this you will need to set the timezone, and will
be asked if the machine is going to run X or not (it doesn't do
the X configuration during install). After this it will populate
the /dev/ directory, and then dump you to a root prompt. Type in
&quot;halt&quot; and hit any key when it tells you to. Don't
forget to take the floppy disk and/or CDROM out.</p>
<p><b>Configuration</b></p>
<p>This is something I hated at first, simply because OpenBSD is
&quot;different&quot; from what I am used to, but after a few
hours I must say it grew on me, and I now wish Linux did things
the OpenBSD way. Log in to your machine using the root account,
if you do not know how to navigate using sh, or edit files using
vi I suggest you check the resources and come back. First you
will need to enable IP forwarding, by default OpenBSD will not
pass packets between interfaces, which is a good idea for
security. Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file and uncomment the line:</p>
<pre>#net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 # 1=Permit forwarding (routing) or packets</pre>
<pre>net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 # 1=Permit forwarding (routing) or packets</pre>
<p>Then edit /etc/rc.conf and turn on IP Filtering and IP NAT.</p>
<pre>ipfilter=NO
ipnat=NO		# for &quot;YES&quot; ipfilter must also be &quot;YES&quot;</pre>
<p>To:</p>
<pre>ipfilter=YES	# ipfiltering?
ipnat=YES		# for &quot;YES&quot; ipfilter must also be &quot;YES&quot;</pre>
<p>You will also need to edit the IP filter rules and IP NAT
table. For now we will allow any and all data traffic, you can
always add rules later. Put the following into /etc/ipf.rules:</p>
<pre>pass out from any to any
pass in from any to any</pre>
<p>Assuming de0 is your external interface, and 192.168.0.0 is
your internal protected network you will want something like this
in /etc/ipnat.rules:</p>
<pre>map de0 192.168.0.0/24 -&gt; de0/32 portmap tcp/udp 10000:20000
map de0 192.168.0.0/24 -&gt; de0/32</pre>
<p>This means map traffic going through de0 (the external
interface) from 192.168.0.0/24 (the internal network, so
obviously this traffic is bound for the Internet) to the IP
addresses associated with de0 (you can set this to 1.2.3.4/32 for
example). I prefer to use the interface/netmask because many
machines I administer are on DHCP networks, so it takes some
guess work out of the equation.</p>
<p>Reboot and you should be able to reach the Internet from your
internal protected network. There is more extensive documentation
at OpenBSD's website, and the various man pages (man ipnat, man
ipf, and so on) also contain good information.</p>
<p><b>Securing the machine</b></p>
<p>On a firewall machine you should disable as much as possible.
Turning off inetd and portmap (pretty much the only services
installed and on by default in OpenBSD) will plug most of your
holes. You should then install SSH so that your remote logins are
encrypted. To disable inetd and portmap simply edit /etc/rc.conf:</p>
<pre>portmap=YES # almost always needed
inetd=YES # almost always needed</pre>
<p>And set them to:</p>
<pre>portmap=NO # almost always needed
inetd=NO # almost always needed</pre>
<p>Doing this will leave no externally available network daemons
running, apart from SSH of course. Use &quot;netstat -an&quot; to
list open sockets (i.e. the ones in state &quot;LISTEN&quot;).
One note, you will see port 514 open, this is the port used by
syslog, and unless you change syslog so that it runs in
&quot;INSECURE&quot; mode, it will only use this port to SEND
messages, it does not listen to it. Do not run syslog in
&quot;INSECURE&quot; unless you are using OpenBSD as a remote
logging box and are aware of the potential problems.</p>
<p><b>SSH</b></p>
<p>Since SSH is not yet included with OpenBSD I thought it would
be prudent to cover installation of it. Start by getting the
ports file (ports.tar.gz) from your favorite OpenBSD site, then
unpack it to /usr, and start the SSH compile:</p>
<pre>cd /usr
tar -zxf ~/ports.tar.gz
cd ports/security/ssh/
make USA_RESIDENT=YES
make install</pre>
<p>You should of course use &quot;make USA_RESIDENT=NO&quot; if
you are not in the US. This is due to the patents on RSA. By
default SSH is turned on, if for some reason it isn't simply edit
/etc/rc.conf:</p>
<pre>sshd=YES # run sshd if it exists</pre>
<p>And reboot to ensure everything works.&nbsp;If it doesn't take
the typical trouble shooting methods of reading the boot up
messages, followed by pinging hosts from other hosts on the same
network, then pinging the external interface from an internal
host, and so on. Generally speaking most errors will be a typo or
something left out, and not &quot;broken&quot; software.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>OpenBSD provides a very stable network operating system that
is extremely secure. It is the only operating system I have seen
that is widely available and includes strong crypto (IPSec, etc.)
built into the basic distribution. It's network performance is
also ahead of most other systems, especially in the areas of
network sniffing (see the Anzen research paper for some startling
results). I would highly recommend OpenBSD for firewall and IDS
based systems.&nbsp;</p>
