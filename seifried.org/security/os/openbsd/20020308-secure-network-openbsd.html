<p>This isn't a totally conventional article. I'm not going to be
recommending you replace every UNIX server you've got with
OpenBSD.&nbsp; Although the OpenBSD team did release 2.7 just
last week, making it very hard not to cover its new features,
this article will be a bit of both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most networks share a few common traits:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>They are made up of heterogeneous pieces (i.e. some
Linux, some Windows, Solaris, etc.)</li>
<li>They evolve over time, and this growth may or may not be
entirely planned and mapped out</li>
<li>There is usually more then one system/network
administrator, and they don't always communicate fully.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how can OpenBSD help with these problems? Well, first off:
if you plan to track, probe and monitor your network from a
central machine, it had better be secure. If someone breaks into
these boxes, chances are you won't notice their activity on the
network since it looks like normal internal scans/etc. The data
collected by these machines will tend to be sensitive (i.e. a
list of all your mail servers and what versions of Sendmail they
are running). OpenBSD is the perfect candidate for this type of
work; it's got solid security and an extremely capable network
stack (important if you processing and generating a lot of
network traffic. One major new upgrade with OpenBSD is support
for gigabit network cards, so you can attach it to anything from
the slowest LAN to the fastest LAN. Once you have installed your
OpenBSD boxes, you need various software packages to aid you in
your quest for network security. OpenBSD makes this trivially
easy to do with the ports collection. Instead of shipping
pre-compiled packages and having some huge central repository
that attempts to contain them all, the BSD family uses the ports
system. The ports system is essentially a gigantic collection of
software packages, with comments, a description, MD5 sums of the
tarballs, and makefiles (detailed instructions for the compiler
on how to build the package). You simply find the package you
want, run &quot;make&quot; to compile it, and then &quot;make
install&quot; to create an install package and install it. If you
want to update something, simply get a newer ports file and redo
the process. This process is also very difficult to subvert.
Since the ports package ships with MD5 (Message Digest version
5), a relatively secure cryptographic hash function, the chances
of an attacker being able to create a source code package with
the same MD5 sum are very slim. So which packages are useful for
securing your network? I'll break them down into several main
areas:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Port/network scanning programs</li>
<li>Intrusion/penetration scanning programs</li>
<li>General network management</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not too sure of the terminology since I've seen varied
usage, so I'll explain each area. &quot;Port/network scanning
programs&quot; in my mind are programs that either probe IP
addresses or TCP/UDP/ICMP ports to see if services are available
or not. This also includes programs like Firewalk which attempts
to map out ports a firewall is allowing and blocking.
&quot;Intrusion/penetration scanning programs&quot; are programs
that test for known vulnerabilities, For example, looking at the
version of Sendmail a server has and telling you if it is
vulnerable or not, and optionally may actually try to exploit the
problem to see if it works; this can of course result in
problems. The last is &quot;General network management&quot;,
tools like MRTG, Multi Router Traffic Graph, which helps you spot
unusual network behavior and can also help you plan out future
needs. The latest copy of the snapshot file is:
/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/ports.tar.gz and I would recommend it over
the copy in /pub/OpenBSD/2.7/ simply because a lot of the
software gets frequent updates; with software, especially
security related software, it's important to be up to date.
Simply download the ports file and unpack it in the /usr/
directory (i.e. cd /usr ; tar -zxf ~/ports.tar.gz). </p>
<p>My favorite port scanning program is by far nmap. This thing
has dozens of options and can conduct a wide variety (probably
the widest) of scans from simple SYN scans to bouncing very
strange packets off of open ftp servers. You will find nmap in
the net/nmap/ directory; it should compile without any problems.
The man page for nmap is exhaustive, options include controlling
the speed of scans (useful for slipping past IDS systems, or
stress testing firewalls), generating random IP's to test (useful
for creating statistics and &quot;discovering&quot; servers).
Scanning from a relatively slow machine, like sub P100, running
OpenBSD you can easily scan a class B address for most
interesting ports in a day or two. Your main limits will be
bandwidth and handling opening ports. This means most
organizations can easily afford to scan their entire network
daily. This can be very beneficial to security; by comparing
daily reports of the open and closed ports, you can track
additions of new servers and ensure they are secured properly.
Simply comparing daily files with diff or uniq can generate a
relatively comprehensive report of what services are available on
your network. Another scanner is strobe; while somewhat more
limited then nmap for options, it is blazingly fast and simple to
use, you can find it in security/strobe/. Now that you have a
list of open ports (and generally speaking they will map to the
expected services, but not always), you can now do some more in-
depth probing.</p>
<p>Probably the best free network security scanner is Nessus.
Using a client / server architecture, it is very platform
independent. With the server running on UNIX and NT, the client
portion runs on UNIX, Windows and in Java. There are over 400
tests, written in a custom plug-in language which makes the
writing of new tests extremely easy, and additional information
such as the solution can be included in the test script. The
reports it generates are also very nice, with solutions (if
offered in the test script) and output formatted in HTML, text,
LaTeX, and &quot;.nsr&quot; format (which can be read in by
Nessus clients and used to view the data). The tests also include
denial of service attacks, so be careful when running Nessus
against production machines. However, it is probably a wise idea
to hammer production machines during off time, since attackers
will probably hit them during prime time. For pure CGI scanning
(useful if you are a web hosting provider or similar), the tool
of choice would be whisker, in security/whisker/. Whisker is a
pure CGI scanner with a lot of nifty options and features; it's
ideal for finding out what you left enabled on the new web
server. Whisker comes with a database of scans to attempt and you
can easily add items, so if you purchase some new web based
product you can easily scan it for problems.</p>
<p>With all this cool scanning going on you probably want to try
to avoid detection by IDS systems and firewalls. By using
fragrouter in security/fragrouter/ you can severely mangle
packets and slip them past many systems. Additionally, some
systems will crash under the stress of fragmented packets. It's
better to find out on your own than let an attacker exploit it.
Many older IDS systems did not properly, if at all, check
fragmented packets; this is an ideal way of finding IDS systems
that need to be updated in your organization.</p>
<p>This last network scanning tool didn't really fit into network
scanning so I stuck it out on its own. Oftentimes when an
attacker gains access to a machine on a network, the first tool
they will install is a network sniffer. This allows them to suck
up passwords and other interesting data easily. Antisniff is
ideal for detecting these types of network sniffers (of course it
isn't 100% accurate, but it's a whole lot better than nothing).
Antisniff will not detect hardware based sniffers or induction
taps or other &quot;sophisticated&quot; methods of sniffing, but
as a rule of thumb, these require physical access to the network,
which prevents most attackers from using them. </p>
<p>In conclusion, an OpenBSD box or two loaded up with free
software can help you secure your network and make collecting
information significantly easier. If possible, try to have an
OpenBSD box on each network segment between firewalls so you can
completely monitor the network, also have an offsite box or two
that will allow you to conduct scans with access equivalent to
what most attackers would have. Old cast-off Pentium machines are
perfect for the task, and since the software is free, usually the
main obstacle is getting permission to conduct potentially
hazardous scans on your network(s). Probably the easiest way to
convince management is by pointing out that attackers will do it
anyway, and if you are feeling particularly brave to do it and
present them with the findings (and the fact that you probably
went undetected). Next week I'm going to look at various methods
for placing backdoors in machines, and methods for
preventing/detecting/disabling them.</p>
