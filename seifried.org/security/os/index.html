as secure as OpenBSD</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Well my mother just finished knitting me a
new pair of asbestos booties so I thought it was high time I
try them out. Set phasers to &quot;flame&quot;. Please read
the entire article before using them. Just remember, I could
have copped out by making the title something like &quot;Will
Linux ever be as secure as OpenBSD?&quot; or even &quot;Which
is more secure, Linux or OpenBSD?&quot;. But I didn't. As
well you should check out the LASG/LSKB if you haven't
already. I also know about ImmunixOS from WireX and the NSA's
SELinux (go read last week's column!). </font></p>

<p><a href="20011107-openbsd-linux.html">Why OpenBSD will never
be as secure as Linux</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Set flame guns to kill. Please read the
entire article before flaming me, as many of your
concerns/etc will probably be answered next week. OpenBSD and
Linux, two decidedly different operating systems. OpenBSD
claims to be &quot;secure by default&quot;, and has undergone
an extensive code audit, so the question is: have I been hit
in the head with a blunt object, or what? Security is an
extremely complex subject with a variety of definitions. This
article is an attempt to educate people, I personally
consider OpenBSD to be a reasonably &quot;secure&quot;
operating system, in some ways more secure then your average
Linux distribution. However people have a wide variety of
needs when it comes to security, and some of these needs are
not met by Linux more so then OpenBSD. There are a variety of
security products and software suites for Linux currently
available and a number of security projects in the works that
will have a significant effect. Depending upon your exact
needs, budget, level of expertise and so on there is almost
surely a security solution for Linux that will fit your
needs. </font></p>
