<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Windows 95 and 98 are designed for single user workstations
and end consumer environments. Windows 95 and 98 are not capable
of using more then one CPU (unlike Windows NT and 2000), they do
not have memory protection (you can boot Linux from within
Windows for example) and have no file security or real concept of
users. What this means is that there is no real concept of
security within Windows 95 and 98. If you can run code on the
machine you can do anything you want, from modifying system files
to destroying the partition table.</p>
<h2>Best Defenses</h2>
<p>Your best defenses in Windows 95 and 98 are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Remove unneeded network services</li>
<li>Update software regularly</li>
<li>Install an Anti-Virus scanner</li>
<li>Install a personal firewall</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Remove unneeded network services</strong></h3>
<p>Removing unneeded network services is critical in windows 95
and 98 since the default is to install the windows network client
when networking protocols such as TCP-IP are installed. With this
software component installed a remote attacker can find out a lot
about your computer. By querying your machine remotely, for
example from an NT box:</p>
<pre>nbtstat -A 10.3.0.1</pre>
<pre>	NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table

Name			Type	Status
---------------------------------------------
WORKSTATION0	&lt;00&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKGROUP	&lt;00&gt;	GROUP	Registered 
WORKSTATION0	&lt;03&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 

MAC Address = 00-60-82-F8-F4-93</pre>
<p>Workstation0 is the name of the workstation, and Workgroup is
the name of the workgroup, the numeric code is the service. With
Windows file and print sharing enabled the remote attacker can
find out even more information:</p>
<pre>	NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table

Name			Type	Status
---------------------------------------------
WORKSTATION0	&lt;00&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKGROUP	&lt;00&gt;	GROUP	Registered 
WORKSTATION0	&lt;03&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKSTATION0	&lt;20&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKGROUP	&lt;1E&gt;	GROUP	Registered 
USERNAME	&lt;03&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 
WORKSTATION0	&lt;1F&gt;	UNIQUE	Registered 

MAC Address = 00-00-D2-E8-F2-53</pre>
<p>They now have your username, and can connect to any shared
files or printers you posses. Using share level controls can
partially protect you, however I would not recommend depending
upon it to share out and restrict access to resources. For the
vast majority of home users removing the windows client as well
as file and print sharing will not impinge on functionality if
you do not need to share out any resources, or access resources
on other windows machines. If you do need to share out files and
printers you cannot selectively bind services to adapters, so all
adapters will be vulnerable (in NT you would be able to shutdown
services on a public interface connected to the Internet, but
leave them enabled on an internal interface connected to your
LAN). </p>
<p>Click on &quot;Start&quot; &gt; &quot;Settings&quot; &gt;
&quot;Control Panel&quot; and then choose &quot;Network&quot;:</p>
<p><img src="images/windows9x/network.jpg" width="366" height="458"></p>
<p>Then select &quot;File and printer sharing for Microsoft
Networks&quot; and click remove, do the same for &quot;Client for
Microsoft Networks&quot;.</p>
<h3><strong>Update software regularly</strong></h3>
<p>This is relatively easy in Windows 95, and extremely easy in
Windows 98. Download the updates for Windows 95 and then install
them (one at a time, rebooting after each one as needed). </p>
<p>In Windows 98 they decided to make it easier, adding a link to
the website on the primary start menu. Simple click on the
&quot;Windows Update&quot; links, which takes you to:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>From there a small applet loads and does an inventory of what
you have installed, and which version, then the items you need
are displayed on a webpage, in descending order of importance
(Critical security fixes first). You then click on the item, and
download and install it, some fixes have to be installed on their
own, and some you can install several at a time. You can also go
to the above corporate URL if you wish to download the fixes
(extremely useful if you have more then one Windows 98 machine). </p>
<h3><strong>Install an Anti-Virus scanner</strong></h3>
<p>There are many good anti-virus programs for Windows 95 and 98,
the majority have a scanning component and virus signatures as
well as access to upgrades (some more automated then others).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.antivirus.com/">http://www.antivirus.com/</a>
- TrendMicro (PC-cillin, about $30USD for single license)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.norton.com/">http://www.norton.com/</a> -
Norton (Anti-Virus, about $70 USD for single license)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mcafee.com/">http://www.mcafee.com/</a> -
McAfee (Virus Clinic, about $30USD per year per license)</p>
<h3><strong>Install a personal firewall</strong></h3>
<p>If your machine is online (as most are) then a personal
firewall is a good idea. When installed properly and configured
correctly they will stop most network based attacks cold. Again
they range in price from free and up, most have some sort of
subscription service for updates as well. I reccomend ZoneAlarm
for home users since it is free and easy to setup:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/">http://www.zonelabs.com/</a>
- ZoneLabs (ZoneAlarm, free, including upgrades)</p>
