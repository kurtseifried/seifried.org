<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Windows NT was Microsoft's first attempt at an industrial
strength business oriented operating system, and by the time NT
4.0 rolled around they had done quite a good job. NT supports
advanced file permissions in the form of Access Control Lists,
users and groups, and other needed security features. The problem
is however that in an effort to make NT usable the default
permissions on files are registry entries are extremely
permissive (everybody has full control). </p>
<h4>Best Defenses</h4>
<p>Your best defenses in Windows NT are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Remove unneeded network services </li>
<li>Update software regularly </li>
<li>Tighten file permissions</li>
<li>Tighten registry permissions</li>
<li>Install an Anti-Virus scanner </li>
<li>Install a firewall </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Remove unneeded network services </strong></h2>
<p>Unfortunately there are not many services you can disable if
you are using it for file and print sharing and authentication.
Fortunately most of these machines are on LANs and access from
the Internet is restricted, so chances are if someone attacks it
it will be from an internal source. This is why keeping the
software up to date is so critical. However for publicly
accessible machines such as web servers you should not rely on
Windows file sharing, unless you have some sort of VPN and
firewall to protect it. Also for gateway servers, proxy servers
and other machine with connections to public and internal
networks you can easily disable file and print sharing on the
external adapter only, leaving it enable don the internal one.
Although Windows NT does have built in packet filtering, it does
not work properly and I would not recommend using it.</p>
<p>First open up network settings, &quot;Start&quot;,
&quot;Settings&quot;, &quot;Network&quot;, and choose the
&quot;Bindings&quot; tab:</p>
<p><img src="images/windowsnt/network-bindings.jpg" width="369" height="454"></p>
<p>Choose &quot;Show Bindings for&quot; and select &quot;all
adapters&quot;, then expand the tree view:</p>
<p><img src="images/windowsnt/network-bindings-adapter.jpg" width="367" height="454"></p>
<p>Assuming the Interl 10/100 card is your internal interface,
and the Acer PCI card is your external interface you would want
to disable the WINS Client on it, to be on the safe side you
should disable all the services, simply highlight them and click
&quot;Disable&quot;:</p>
<p><img src="images/windowsnt/network-bindings-adapter-disabled.jpg" width="369" height="454"></p>
<p>You can now click on &quot;OK&quot; and then you will have to
reboot the computer. </p>
<p>The Server service is the actuall file and printer sharing.
The Workstation service allows you to connect to other servers,
this is dangerous because it potentially allows a remote attacker
to connect to a remote site and retrieve data (such as a trojan
horse they want to load on your machine), and in some cases
passwords can be found be having the target computer connect out
and try to access resources on an attackers machine. </p>
<h2><strong>Update software regularly </strong></h2>
<p>There are two sets of fixes for NT and related products, the
first are hotfixes, these are solutions to (usually) individual
problems, released several days or weeks after the problem is
found. These hotfixes are tested, however they are not completely
regression tested, so on occasion they may break some feature or
misbehave. Every once in a while all the current fixes are rolled
up into one big package, called a service pack. These service
packs are extensively tested and include hundreds of fixes
(calc.exe is replaced for example), they rarely break things (but
it has been known to happen). The following URL's have links to
download the various fixes needed for NT:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/NTServer/all/downloads.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/NTServer/all/downloads.asp</a>
</p>
<p><a href="http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp">http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp</a>
</p>
<p>This is probably the first thing you should do after
installing an NT server, you will need to apply the latest
service pack, and numerous hotfixes, which can take a while since
you MUST reboot in between them (do not try to install multiple
hotfixes without rebooting, you will likely damage your software
installation). </p>
<h2><strong>Tighten file permissions</strong></h2>
<p>Although NT supports file ACL's (Access Control Lists) the
default permissions are that the group everybody has &quot;full
control&quot;, meaning anyone that can log in locally, or access
files via a fileshare can create, delete, modify or otherwise
manipulate files and directories. This is especially critical on
machines that are part of a domain since backups of the SAM
(Security Account Manager) are stored in:</p>
<pre>C:\Winnt\repair\sam._</pre>
<p>Or wherever your NT installation directory is. Once an
attacker has this file they can run it through a password
cracking program such as L0phtcrack, since NT uses less then
optimal password storage techniques, combined with the speed of
password cracking programs it is pretty much guaranteed that an
attacker will glean some passwords. The repair directory should
be protected, open up &quot;Windows NT Explorer&quot; and go into
your NT installation directory, then right click on the
&quot;repair&quot; directory, choose &quot;Security&quot; and
remove the group &quot;everyone&quot; from the listing. This is
just one example of literally hundreds of bad file permissions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately if you try to protect the C:\Winnt\System and
C:\Winnt\System32 chances are you will break many common
applications since they want to be able to access files in these
directories and in some cases write to them. A partial solution
is to use system policies and restrict the applications people
can run, i.e. restrict a user to:</p>
<pre>C:\Program Files\Officesuite\office.exe
C:\Winnt\Notepad.exe</pre>
<p>There is also a product from SecureWave called SecureExe who's
primary purpose is to prevent trojan software from being
executed, but can also prevent users from say copying
regedt32.exe over notepad.exe and running is (since it not only
check the file name, but a cryptographically secure hash of it
[SHA1]). These two topics are discussed in more depth later on.</p>
<h2><strong>Tighten registry permissions</strong></h2>
<p>The same problem that affects file security exists for
registry permissions, they default is extremely promiscuous. NT
ships with two registry editing programs, one has the ability to
manipulate security permissions and is extremely functional
(regedt32.exe), the other has a search function, but you cannot
modify permissions and so on (regedit.exe), which makes securing
the registry a very tedious process. </p>
<p>Using regedt32.exe simply open up the registry on the
appropriate computer (the default is the local computer), find
the key or keys you wish to secure and choose
&quot;Security&quot; and then &quot;Permissions&quot; and you can
easily modify who is able to manipulate the key. </p>
<p>A freeware/commercial solution is RegDACL from Heysoft, the
freeware version is slightly stripped down but still very
functional. You can easily script modifications and it makes
modifying registry security permissions much faster (since
chances are you want to do the same thing on many computers). You
can download it from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heysoft.de/index.htm">http://www.heysoft.de/index.htm</a></p>
<h2><strong>Install an Anti-Virus scanner </strong></h2>
<p>Even with all these precautions it is still possible for a
virus to slip in and do something malicious. Best case scenario
it infects some data which you need only disinfect or restore
from backup, worst case it replicates itself via email and takes
out your entire network. As well many trojan programs for NT are
detected by the majority of anti-virus scanners, they are an
integral part of any security policy.</p>

<h2><strong>Install a firewall </strong></h2>
<p>If your machine is attached directly to the Internet you
should definetely install a firewall product, if it is on an
internal network it is also a good idea (since many attacks come
from internal sources). </p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Auditing events</strong></h3>
<p>The Windows NT event logger is extremely useful for detecting
suspicious activity and nefarious user actions. Like most Windows
NT security features it is not turned on by default. The first
step is to increase the log size, as the default is to only keep
512 kilobytes of logs and overwrite events older then 7 days old.
I would reccomend setting the log size to several hundred
megabytes, or gigabytes if you want to do extensive logging (disk
space is cheap). Setting the log file to &quot;Overwrite Events
as Needed&quot; will result in the log &quot;wrapping&quot;, as
space is needed the oldest event will be blown away, this is
somewhat better then &quot;Do Not Overwrite Events (Clear Log
Manually)&quot; which once full will stop recording logging
events. However the danger in overwriting log events is that an
attacker may try to cover their tracks by flooding the log files
and overwriting the events that could help reconstruct what
happened. In any event a tool is now available:
&quot;WinZapper&quot; which can be used to delete log entries.</p>
<p><a href="http://ntsecurity.nu/toolbox/winzapper/">http://ntsecurity.nu/toolbox/winzapper/</a>
- WinZapper</p>
<p>The good news however is that WinZapper cannot be used
remotely, so the user must install a trojan such as BackOrifice
2000 to use it (unless of course someone modifies WinZapper for
remote usage, which is far from impossible). You can also not run
Event Viewer after using WinZapper, you must reboot, so two
indications that WinZapper has been used would be if the server
is unexpectedly rebooted or if you cannot run Event Viewer. As
well a file called &quot;dummy.dat&quot; is left, this is a copy
of the original log file, so without modifications the tool is
easily detected (again, this modification will happen, so don't
depend on being able to find a dummy.dat file). It is primarily a
proof of concept that once administrative access is gained you
can no longer trust the event logs (this is true of most
operating systems unless you use some type of secure off system
logging). </p>
<p>To enable logging you must first go to &quot;Start&quot;,
&quot;Programs&quot;, &quot;Administrative Tools (Common)&quot;,
and select &quot;User Manage for Domains&quot;. Then click on
&quot;Policies&quot; and choose &quot;Audit&quot;. You can
selectively audit events like user logins/logoffs, file and
object access (warning, this will generate a lot of log entries),
user and group management and so on. You can also audit successes
and/or failures, unless you are extremely concerned about
security auditing failed events only is probably sufficient.
However for some sensitive environments you may wish to know
exactly when users are accessing certain files. Once you have
enabled auditing on &quot;File and bject Access&quot; you will
need to enable auditing in the filesystem, this is good news
because you can extremely selective on which files and
directories you audit (otherwise there would be a huge amount of
&quot;noise&quot; for normal system activity). Open up the
&quot;Windows NT Explorer&quot; and select the directory or files
you wish to enable auditing on, then right click, choose
&quot;Security&quot; and &quot;Auditing&quot;. You can audit
access by certain users and groups (for example accounts
belonging to temp workers might be included in the audit, but not
fulltime workers), and you can audit the events selectively
(Read, Write, Execute, Delete, Change Permission and Take
Ownership) and whether they succeed or fail. Use the
&quot;Everone&quot; group if you wish to record anyone accessing
files. </p>
<p>One problem with all of this is that you can enable/disable
logging on the fly without requiring a reboot, while convinient
it does allow an attacker to disable auditing before they attempt
to access something, and they can then turn the auditing back on,
or leave it disabled (chances are most administrators will not
notice). You should periodically check to make sure auditing is
enabled properly, or have a test account to access objects so you
can verify that the access is logged.</p>
<h3><strong>Implementing system policies</strong></h3>
<p>System policies will be covered later as they are a reasonably
complex topic.</p>
<h3><strong>Preventing trojan binaries</strong></h3>
<p>Even with System policies installed and enforced it is
possible for an attacker to circumvent them. Let's say for
example you have restricted the programs a user can run, even
with the full patchname specified it is possible for someone to
run arbitrary programs if they can overwrite one of the programs
they have access to. For example if you let UserA run
C:\Winnt\notepad.exe, and you have not tightened up permissions
they can simply copy regedt32.exe overtop of it and run it. </p>
<p>One solution is to use SecureExe from SecureWave:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.securewave.com/html/secure_exe.html">http://www.securewave.com/html/secure_exe.html</a></p>
<p>This program uses the SHA1 signature algorithm, in addition to
the program's name/path, if the stored signature for calc.exe
doesn't match the one in the database you cannot run calc.exe. An
attacker can copy over a file, but the signature will not match,
and it will not be run. No pricing or availability yet, however
they do have an online demo using Microsoft's Terminal Server.</p>
<h3><strong>Restricting access to removable devices</strong></h3>
<p>For a variety of reasons it is desirable to restrict user
access to removable devices such as floppy disks, cdrom drives,
printer ports and communication ports. Unfortunately NT does not
have any facilities to control access to these ports selectively.
Disabling them in the BIOS is possible but then you must reboot
and enter a password at the BIOS prompt to reenable them, not a
workable solution by any means. The good news is that there is a
nice commercial product from SecureWave, called SecureNT (it also
supports Win9x). This loads a VXD at startup which controls
access to any removable media, and the com and printer ports.
This allows you to easily prevent the user from plugging a modem
in and setting up dial-in access, or plugging a parallel port
cd-burner in and stealing corporate data. </p>

<h3><strong>Host based intrusion detection</strong></h3>
<p>Manually checking to make sure no-one has breached your
security and reveiwing log files is an extremely time intensive
and tedious process. Luckily there exist many software packages
that will do it for you, filter the results and alert you to
suspicious activity. </p>
