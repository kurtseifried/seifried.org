will never be as secure OpenBSD</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set flame guns to kill. Please read the entire article before
flaming me, as many of your concerns/etc will probably be
answered next week. OpenBSD and Linux, two decidedly different
operating systems. OpenBSD claims to be &quot;secure by
default&quot;, and has undergone an extensive code audit, so the
question is: have I been hit in the head with a blunt object, or
what? Security is an extremely complex subject with a variety of
definitions. This article is an attempt to educate people, I
personally consider OpenBSD to be a reasonably &quot;secure&quot;
operating system, in some ways more secure then your average
Linux distribution. However people have a wide variety of needs
when it comes to security, and some of these needs are not met by
Linux more so then OpenBSD. There are a variety of security
products and software suites for Linux currently available and a
number of security projects in the works that will have a
significant effect. Depending upon your exact needs, budget,
level of expertise and so on there is almost surely a security
solution for Linux that will fit your needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>SubDomain, StackGuard &amp; FormatGuard</strong></h2>
<p>WireX ships a hardened version of Linux using a number of
security enhancements. The most obvious would be SubDomain, which
allows you to specify which files a program may access and in
what manner (read, write, execute or list). This allows you to
tightly contain software, you do not need to make any changes to
the software or go through the problems associated with using
chroot() (which for packages like Sendmail can be extremely
complex). There is no equivalent to SubDomain in OpenBSD. Other
benefits of WireX include StackGuard and FormatGuard, while it
can be argued that because OpenBSD's code has been audited it
doesn't need StackGuard or FormatGuard but the simple fact
remains that buffer overflows and format strings attacks are
still being discovered in OpenBSD. The beauty of these three
technologies from WireX is that you do not need a huge amount of
expertise or time to implement, and SubDomain can protect
software available in binary only formats. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Openwall kernel patch</strong></h2>
<p>The Openwall kernel patch is a relatively simple set of kernel
patches that once compiled in will prevent or stop a number of
problems. A non-executable user stack area prevents various
buffer overflows, and while it can be circumvented it definitely
raises the bar for attackers. Restricting links and FIFO's in tmp
is another feature, and again while OpenBSD has audited it's code
and removed most of the /tmp vulnerabilities there are no
guarantees about software in the ports package or binary only
software. Once this software is installed you do not need to do
anything more, there is no configuration required or additional
setup when you install new software, removing any chance of
accidentally forgetting to protect software/etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Argus PitBull LX</h2>
<p>PitBull LX is a commercial product for Linux that comes as a
binary kernel (and kernel headers if you want to create your own
custom kernel) and various utilities to configure the security
settings. The primary benefit PitBull LX offers is Mandatory
Access Controls, one of the main differences between this and
Discretionary Access Controls (what Linux has by default) is that
not even root can tamper with files in a MAC capable system.
Additionally controls can be placed on network devices and even
ports themselves, you can specify that port 53 and all the files
necessary for running BIND are one security domain, if Bind is
compromised it will not be able to do anything outside it's
domain (i.e. write to /etc/passwd). Controls can also be placed
on IPC (inter process communication) objects, allowing for fine
configurations of processes, files, network objects and so on.
This capability, while complicated and non-trivial allows for a
certain flexibility lacking in OpenBSD. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>NSA SELinux</strong></h2>
<p>NSA SELinux is a set of kernel patches and modified utilities
that allow for extremely granular control of security settings
that are similar (but different) then PitBull LX. SELinux
provides &quot;Type Enforcement&quot;, &quot;Role-based Access
Control&quot; and &quot;Multi-level Security&quot; (not to be
confused with multi-level marketing). Basically anything you can
imagine is possible. You want to restrict port 80 to a certain
process? You can do that. Want to restrict a certain process from
accessing files? You can do that. Completely lock down the system
so that even with root level access very little damage can be
done? You can do that. Unfortunately this software is extremely
non-trivial, and has a steep </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>LIDS</strong></h2>
<p>LIDS is a far less complicated project then PitBull LX or NSA
SELinux. LIDS provides a variety of features ranging from
increased filesystem protection to a number of capabilities that
allow an administrator to &quot;lock&quot; a system into a
certain configuration that then requires a significant amount of
effort (i.e. console access or a reboot) to modify. For example
the &quot;CAP_SYS_ADMIN&quot; capability lets you restrict the
setting of the machines domainname, hostname, turning swap on or
off, the configuration of serial ports and so on. While OpenBSD
does have a somewhat similar system in the form of BSD
securelevel LIDS is more flexible in many respects. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Medusa DS9</strong></h2>
<p>Yet another security system for Linux that allows an
administrator to control access to files, various process
actions, system calls and more. One interesting feature of Medusa
DS9 is the ability to redirect access from one file to another
instead, as well as useful in a security setting it can be used
with chrooting or for debugging programs. Like LIDS, NSA SELinux,
PitBull, SubDomain and so on Medusa allows for increased control
of processes and files on a given system, again no comparable
software is available for OpenBSD. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see there is a large selection of security software
Linux, ranging from simple items like the Openwall kernel patch
to very configurable security suites like PitBull LX. These
solutions are simply not available for OpenBSD, so if you have
needs beyond the basic User/Group/Other filesystem restrictions
for example you are basically out of luck. Restricting access to
port 80 for example, while easily achieved in Linux with NSA
SELinux or PitBull LX is basically impossible in OpenBSD.
Protecting binary software can be done in Linux with a variety of
tools, doing so in OpenBSD is very difficult (there is little you
can do). Even with some of the most secure source code in the
world OpenBSD will not be capable of providing the same levels of
security and trust that a Linux system with the appropriate
software (i.e. NSA SELinux or PitBull) can. For a system to be
both secure and trusted you need both secure code and additional
items that provide Mandatory Access Controls, RBAC, Type
enforcement and so on.<font color="#000000"> This is why OpenBSD
will never be as secure as Linux.</font></p>
