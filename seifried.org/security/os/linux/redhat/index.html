<p>Having just installed Red Hat 7.2 on a production server I
feel a certain emotion that I am sure many people share. Red Hat
7.1 (previous version) was excellent, it had Postfix in the power
tools, it was a rock solid distro. Red Hat 7.2 isn't bad either,
I am very happy with the ext3 support, it seamlessly migrated my
fileserver to it, boot times are much improved sans fsck. However
the upgrade road has not been free of rocks, potholes and one or
two completely washed out bridges. </p>

OpenSSH 3.4 installation and spec file</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Red Hat will not be issuing OpenSSH 3.4
packages for Red Hat 7.x (can't say that I blame them,
customer support would be a nightmare). Unfortunately I
really wanted OpenSSH 3.4 on my server systems (privsep, all
the bug fixes, etc.). I modifed the Red Hat spec file
slightly, you will need that, the source RPM from Red hat,
and the source code for OpenSSH 3.4 portable. &nbsp;I have
disabled askpass/gnome stuff, this is aimed at servers, not
clients. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><a href="20011031-rh72-sendmail.html">Red Hat 7.2 Sendmail
configuration</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">This has got to be one of the worst and
best features about Red Hat Linux 7.2. My first major
complaint would be the lack of Postfix. Not only did they
fail to ship it on the CD, they failed to include it in
anything like powertools online. To make matters worse the
Postfix RPM from 7.1 does not work properly as it expects
older libraries, although you should be able to get it
working with some effort. But instead of doing all that I
thought I would give Sendmail a chance, I haven't used it in
approximately 2-3 years, and it has been audited (very few
remote root hacks in the last few months, although there were
some local root hacks). There are several significant
problems with the default sendmail configuration and scripts
that manage it. </font></p>

HORDE configuration</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">This has got to be the worst all around
configuration hassle I have had in ages. I wanted to install
and get webmail working. So I install horde and imp, and
blam, tons of problems. </font></p>
