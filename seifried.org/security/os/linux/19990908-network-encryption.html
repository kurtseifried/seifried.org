<p><b>September 8, 1999 &#150; A</b>nd now for the last in my
three part mini-series on Linux encryption; network encryption.
We've covered the basics, and filesystem encryption, however
these systems are absolutely no good if you log into your server
via telnet, and then provide the password to mount your encrypted
home directory. There are also several file encryption systems
that do not lend themselves well to networking, and many file
sharing methods that provide no encryption at all. Encrypting the
data that moves across your network is a simple and effective
answer (ok, it's probably not simple, but you get the idea).</p>
<p><b>The basics</b></p>
<p>There are several levels at which you can encrypt data in a
network setting, so far we have only dealt with methods at the
application and presentation layer. That is to say the encryption
is provided by software and not really integrated with the
network (TCFS being a notable exception). Encryption can be done
at almost any layer of the OSI stack, with various benefits and
drawbacks to each method.</p>

<p>For this article we are concerned with network based
encryption, which typically happens at the session, and / or
transport layer (green). You typically don't encrypt the network
(IP) layer as the routers/etc along the path must be able to view
some data in the packet (like destination). Encryption can also
be done at the application layer (PGP), presentation (X.509
integration with Netscape mailer) which was discussed in my
previous article, or at the datalink layer (modems with
pre-shared secrets and hardware encryption chips) which are in
(blue).</p>
<p><b>Session layer encryption (SSL)</b></p>
<p>Session layer encryption can be achieved with a variety of
add-on protocols. The most popular is SSL (Secure Sockets Layer),
which was originally developed for web based commerce (but like
any good solution can be used elsewhere). SSL provides
authentication and encryption, with the use of public key
encryption and certificates. Like any public key encryption
technology it is susceptible to man in the middle attacks, which
are essentially caused by the fact you have to create a secured
communications channel over an insecure network. To solve this
SSL supports the use of certificates, which are blocks of
information about a party (for example a www server certificate
includes the domain name, issuer, expiry date, and so on) that is
signed by a trusted third party. This still requires the
distribution of public keys for the trusted third party, which is
typically achieved by shipping the keys with the application.
During the course of negotiating a session on party (say the
client, a www browser) can ask the other party (say a www server)
to prove it's identity. In which case the second party would send
the first party it's digital certificate. This can go both ways,
you can buy personal certificate from Verisign, and after proving
who you are, you will be issued a form of digital identification
that you can use to prove who you are to other people (assuming
they trust Verisign).&nbsp;</p>
<p>SSL is relatively easy to implement in applications, there is
a good set of SSL libraries (OpenSSL) freely available to use.
For example you can use Slush which is Telnet with SSL support
built in, and instead of using a username and password to login,
you use a digital certificate as proof of identification. This
can also be done with POP, and IMAP servers (Microsoft and
Netscape both support SSL'ified POP/IMAP out of the box) to
prevent user's passwords from going across the network in plain
text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SSL also lends itself to PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), and
is scaleable. For example your company might buy a certificate
from Verisign so that it in turn can sign certificates for
departments. These departments could then sign your personal
certificate and server certificates, so when you communicate with
another employee or departmental server you can be sure it is who
it claims to be. Unfortunately the costs of PKI (setup and
maintenance) are still very high, and certificates are not very
portable, which has lead to slow acceptance.</p>
<p>SSL is appropriate when you have many short lived connections
(www sessions, pop sessions, etc) between parties that are
unknown to each other. Since SSL supports certificates, assuming
you trust the issuer of the certificate you can for instance
browse on <a href="https://www.seifried.org/">https://www.seifried.org/</a>
(which uses a Thawte site certificate) and be relatively sure you
are in fact browsing on the real site and not a fake one.</p>
<p><b>Network layer encryption (IPSec)</b></p>
<p>Network layer encryption is best done with IPSec (in my
opinion) but can be done with a variety of other tools. IPSec is
set to become an industry standard, and is already supported on
most major platforms (Linux, OpenBSD, Sun, Windows and AIX to
name a few).&nbsp;Like SSL IPSec supports a variety of different
encryption algorithms, however the one used in FreeS/WAN (the
Linux IPSec implementation) is typically 3DES. Currently IPSec
for Linux (and most other implementations) do not support the use
of certificates to prove identity, this is a planned feature.
Despite these drawbacks IPSec is still a viable solution for
encrypting network traffic.</p>
<p>To prevent man in the middle attacks you have a pre-shared
secret between the two (or more) parties participating in that
IPSec configuration. This secret is usually 256 bits, meaning
there are 2^256 possible secrets, making a man in the middle
attack difficult at best. In addition to this the connection can
be automatically re-keyed (the default being 8 hours). If someone
manages to break the session key (168 bits for 3DES), they can
only snoop in on the traffic for that session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One major benefit of IPSec is that it is implemented at the
network layer, which the OS handles, so applications need not be
aware at all that any encryption is going on. Additionally most
operating systems support it, there is even a free client for
Windows 95/98/NT in the form of PGPi. Windows 2000 is listed as
having IPSec support, but I have not yet tried it so I cannot
comment much on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IPSec is an ideal solution if you have heavy data traffic
between several points (currently the lack of certificate support
makes managing large installations painful). Another widespread
use of IPSec is for connecting networks to each other over
insecure network (i.e. the Internet). Simply put a Linux box at
each location and you can now talk securely.</p>
