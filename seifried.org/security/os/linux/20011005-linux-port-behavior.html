<p>I'm feeling clever today. I rebuilt my gateway server, and
decided to go gung-ho when it came to firewalling - a default
deny policy for input, output and forward chains. Needless to
say, this breaks a lot of things. Well, it breaks basically
everything, until you start putting in rules to allow packets
through. Using a default deny policy in Linux is tricky because
the firewall in kernel 2.2 is not stateful. (It is stateful in
2.4, but that is still in a test series and several months off
from release.) With a stateful firewall you can make simple
rules: &quot;If you see an outgoing connection, let the incoming
packets associated with it through.&quot; If your firewall is not
stateful, you will have to create many rules to allow services to
work for clients. This can be annoying if you really want to lock
your firewall down. Here's what it comes down to: Creating a
really tight firewall in Linux is a pain. </p>
<p>But all is not lost. Several tips and tricks can aid you in
creating a tight firewall. The first trick looks at the local
port numbers that the system uses for outgoing connections. All
TCP connections have a source port and address, and a destination
port and address. If you want to control which ports connections
are allowed to go out on - and thus the incoming packets you will
need to allow in - you must know the port range. Otherwise, to
let connections out and the reply data back in, you'll need to
allow all the ports in, 65,535 of them.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is configurable in Linux. You can set it in the
kernel:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c</pre>
<pre>/*
* This array holds the first and last local port number.
* For high-usage systems, use sysctl to change this to
* 32768-61000
*/
int sysctl_local_port_range[2] = { 1024, 4999 };</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Or via the proc interface at any time (i.e. in the network
startup script):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, any outgoing connection will originate from that
port range, allowing you tight control over outgoing and incoming
rules. </p>
<p>But there arises another problem. IP-MASQ'ed connections do
not originate from these defined local source ports, meaning
services will not work properly unless you use some type of proxy
or have permissive rules to allow client connections. The good
news is that most of the IP-MASQ connections appear to originate
from ports in the 61000-65095 range - at least they do on my
server - and this doesn't change between reboots. (Look in
ip_masq.c.)</p>
<p>So if your IP-MASQ'ed connections are originating from ports
61000-65095, and connections from the server itself from
1024-4999, then you need two sets of rules for each thing you
want to allow. Alternatively, you could use it to allow
connections from the IP-MASQ'ed client but not from the server
itself. Using it in this capacity would be pointless, however,
since that can be accomplished in incoming firewall rules for the
IP-MASQ clients, and output rules for the server itself. </p>
<p>So, what good is any of this? Well, if you set the local port
range on your IP-MASQ server to 61000-65095 (assuming you don't
need more than 4000 simultaneous connections - if you do, use a
larger range), it's easy to set via proc:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>echo 61000 65095 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Or if you want it to be permanent, you can set it in the
kernel, though I recommend avoiding kernel hacks if possible. So
with almost all (more on this later) of your connections
originating from ports 61000-65095 on your server, it is very
easy to use a default deny policy and allow selected services.
For example, Web browsing:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ipchains -A output -s 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 61000:65095 -d 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
 80:80 -i eth0 -p 6 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A input -s 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 80:80 -d 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 61000:65095
 ! -y -i eth0 -p 6 -j ACCEPT</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;! -y&quot; means no packets with the SYN bit set
(used to initiate connections), since there should only be
packets from established connections coming in. This works well
for most common services; however, there are two that get quite
messy. FTP requires the remote FTP server to establish inbound
connections with the server, and depending on whether the server
uses passive or active FTP, the ports these connections occur
from can vary significantly.</p>
<p>DNS also requires some messy fiddling, since it relies heavily
on UDP packets. Depending on whether the request is simply
forwarded by the server, generated by the server, or actually
handled by name server software running on the server, can affect
behavior significantly. Generally speaking, the best way to deal
with these is to have some catch-all rules at the end to log all
denied packets, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ipchains -A input -l -s 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 -d 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 -j DENY
ipchains -A output -l -s 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 -d 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 -j DENY
ipchains -A forward -l -s 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 -d 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 -j DENY</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You can then &quot;tail -f /var/log/messages&quot; and watch
as packets are denied. You will then be able to determine what
needs to be allowed through. The following is an entry from
/var/log/messages while using an FTP client on the server:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Oct 17 00:32:46 server kernel: Packet log: input DENY eth0 
PROTO=6 1.2.3.4:20 5.6.7.8:61394
L=44 S=0x00 I=61949 F=0x4000 T=250 SYN (#28)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this is extremely verbose. First off is the time,
followed by the chain (input) and the action taken (DENY). The
protocol is 6 (which according to /etc/protocols is TCP); the
source is 1.2.3.4, port 20 (according to /etc/services this is
ftp-data); and the destination was 5.6.7.8, port 61394, which was
blocked by rule #28 in the input chain. Armed with this
information, and the result of &quot;remote directory listing not
available&quot; in your FTP client, it is a safe bet that you
need to allow connections from port 20 to 61000-65095 if you want
FTP to work properly.</p>
<p>I spent about three days doing this off-and-on fine-tuning of
my firewall. It's also a good way to refresh your memory on
exactly how various strange protocols like FTP work. (OK, I admit
that this kind of thing amuses me, which is probably why I am
currently single.)</p>
<p>Another problem can be setuid or programs run as root that use
&quot;strange&quot; ports as the source port. For example, when
root runs the SSH client to connect outwards, it might use port
1000 or similar, even with the local ports specified. You can
largely avoid this by not running things as root - a good idea in
any case. </p>
