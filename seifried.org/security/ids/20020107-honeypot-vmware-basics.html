<p>Honeypots are becoming more common as security professionals
attempt to conduct more detailed research on current &quot;state
of the art&quot; practices among attackers. Honeypots are also
invaluable for learning about an attackers motivations, their
habits and patterns of behavior. Unfortunately setting up a
proper honeypot is a non-trivial task, and correctly configuring
network sensors to capture all data, as well as the resulting
forensics tasks can be rather daunting. The good news is that
there are a number of tools and techniques that can make life
much easier for some honeypot administrators. </p>
<h2>What is VMware?</h2>
<p>VMware is essentially a set of software products, the
workstation version installs onto Windows or Linux and allows you
to run numerous Intel based operating systems on top of it. There
is also a server line of products aimed at allowing people to run
large numbers of operating systems on a single physical machine,
one version of which provides it's own base operating system.
Essentially this allows you to run multiple Intel based operating
systems on a single physical machine. This alone would be reason
enough for many honeypot administrators to celebrate, but there
are other reasons as well to use VMware that will become evident.
VMware is capable of running all versions of Windows, Linux, most
of the BSD family, Solaris for Intel, Novell NetWare, and a
number of other operating systems are unsupported but can be made
to work. </p>
<p>In this article I will refer to the base operating system that
is running VMware as the host, and the operating system running
within VMware as the guest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Virtual disks vs. raw disk partitions</h2>
<p>Virtual disks are a set of files that VMware presents as a
&quot;real&quot; harddrive to the guest operating system, raw
disk partitions are a &quot;real&quot; partition on a
&quot;real&quot; harddrive that the guest operating system is
given access to. There are several advantages and disadvantages
to either approach, largely depending on what your goals for the
honeypot are. If your purpose is quick research or primarily as
an early warning device and you do not plan to prosecute it is
acceptable to use virtual disks. They allow for easy copying and
recreation of a honeypot once it has been compromised and are the
simplest to install. However if the guest operating system is
sufficiently damaged you will not be able to access it very
easily, and since it uses a custom file format you will not be
able to examine it easily with common forensics tools such as TCT
or EnCase. The major advantage of virtual disks is convenience,
however you will lose much of any ability to perform forensics. </p>
<p>For deeper forensics, and especially if you plan to prosecute
the best option is to use raw disk partitions. I would recommend
using a physically separate harddrive from the host operating
system's harddrive, this will ease partitioning and make
potential cross contamination less likely. There is one primary
piece of advice I feel compelled to offer: use a separate
harddrive and put it in a drive tray to make removal as easy as
possible. If you use drive trays you will be able to quickly swap
the drive into a forensics system, although it is unlikely that
the attacker will be able to break into a properly secured VMware
host machine it is possible. </p>
<p>Setup and installation on a raw disk partition is relatively
straight forward and well documented (especially the problems you
are likely to run in to under Windows). By using an entire disk
you make life much easier for yourself, cloning the drive can be
accomplished by simply dd'ing the contents to an identical drive,
and handling of evidence will be simplified if the only contents
of the harddrive are related to the incident at hand and not
several installations. </p>
<h2>Forensics preparation </h2>
<p>Probably the most important piece of preparation that can be
done is to zero the partitions that the guest operating system
data resides upon. For raw partitions simply zero the partition
as you normally would. For virtual disks things are a bit more
complex, VMware only makes the files as large as is necessary,
growing them as more data is added, thus it is possible for
contamination from existing data on the drive the virtual disks
reside on. To complicate matters if you have multiple virtual
disks (i.e. multiple guest operating systems) on a single
partition as they grow and contract they may use hard disk areas
previously used by other guest operating systems. Probably the
simplest way to deal with this is to partition the drive so that
each guest operating system's virtual disk files reside on a
separate partition, and of course these partitions should be
zeroed before use. </p>
<p>A handy little wiping utility is available from IBM for free
at:<br>
<a href="http://www.storage.ibm.com/hdd/support/download.htm#Wipe">http://www.storage.ibm.com/hdd/support/download.htm#Wipe</a>
<br>
simply unpack it to a floppy disk and then use &quot;wipe x&quot;
where x is the device number (0-7). </p>
<p>For UNIX systems simply use dd to wipe the disk, with a
command such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>dd bs=1000k if=/dev/zero of=/dev/partitionname</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Examining data in memory</h2>
<p>Volatile memory is one of the leading problems for forensics.
Worms such as CodeRed are memory resident and do write themselves
to the harddrive, if you turn the system off they disappear. One
of the major advantages to Honeypotting with VMware is the
ability to get ahold of data in memory and examine it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Encouraging data to the hard disk</h3>
<p>One technique is to give the guest operating system a minimal
amount of memory (say 32 megabytes, or maybe even less), thus
forcing it to use a swap file or partition, this will
&quot;encourage&quot; data to be temporarily stored on the drive,
giving you a much better chance long term of having data to
examine. To &quot;protect&quot; the data written to a swap
partition make the swap partition large, i.e. several hundred
megabytes, in order to reduce the risk of it reusing space. For
Windows simply create a separate partition (say &quot;D&quot;) of
several hundred megabytes and place the swap file there, make
sure that your maximum swap file size is smaller then the
partition or the system may experience difficulties. This may
appear suspicious but can often be explained away as a cautious
admin not wanting the system to crash due to memory constraints. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Suspending the OS</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite features of VMware, the ability to
suspend the guest operating system, externally. Unlike a laptop
system that supports hibernation the VMware suspend command works
on any operating system (not all support laptop hibernation), and
can be used easily on a compromised or heavily damaged system.
When using suspend an image of what is in memory is written to an
external file, one potential problem with using suspend or
hibernation on a &quot;real&quot; system is that the disk may be
full, preventing the ram image from being written properly. The
memory image is placed in the configuration directory you
specified for your guest operating system, for example a VMware
guest system running Linux called &quot;Red Hat Linux would
result in the file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>V:\Red Hat Linux/Red Hat Linux</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This file can be accessed with a variety tools, ranging from
notepad to a hex editor. I highly recommend using
&quot;strings&quot; and &quot;grep&quot; to extract information
quickly. </p>
<p>The other major benefit of this capability is that you can
take a snapshot of a compromised system, copy the files or
partitions that comprise the guest operating system, and at your
leisure run the operating system in the future repeatedly,
allowing you to examine what is taking place. In effect it is
like recording a TV show, you can hit play and rewind repeatedly
to look for details. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Identifying VMware systems</h2>
<p>Against most attackers a VMware system will not raise any
suspicion, most will take the system at face value and assume it
is running on it's own dedicated hardware like a
&quot;normal&quot; system. Unfortunately there are a number of
ways to identify systems running under VMware. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VMware tools</h3>
<p>Of course one dead giveaway is if the system is running VMware
tools, under windows this will show up in &quot;Add/Remove
programs&quot;, the Program Files directory and so forth. For
UNIX there are Xfree86 patches to improve performance, as well as
a complete Xfree86 server optimized for VMware guest operating
systems, both of which can be identified by attackers. Much more
obvious traces are also left, such as /etc/rc.d/init.d/dualconf,
&quot;Copyright (C) 1998-99, VMware Inc.&quot; and the
/etc/vmware-tools/ directory. It is advisable to avoid installing
VMware tools on VMware honeypots if at all possible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>AMD 1 gigahertz with 32 megabytes of ram?</h3>
<p>One problem with VMware is the inability to hide the CPU type
effectively, an astute attacker is likely to wonder why a server
with 32 megabytes of ram has a 1 gigahertz AMD CPU. Unfortunately
this is what will happen, and hiding this fact from an attacker
is difficult. An attacker can simply &quot;cat
/proc/cpuinfo&quot; for example under Linux, and among other
things they will be told the speed, approximately, in MHz.
Removing /proc support in Linux is one way to deal with this, but
there are other ways to query cpu speed, and in other operating
systems hiding the cpu type and speed is not so easy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Computer BIOS</h3>
<p>One way to identify VMware systems is by their BIOS, there are
a number of free windows utilities that can query the BIOS for
information and even extract a copy of the BIOS from the VMware
system. The good news is that from within Windows NT/2000 you
cannot easily access the BIOS and send commands as direct access
to the hardware is blocked. You can however easily query the BIOS
for information from within the guest operating system you will
be given the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>BIOS ID: unknown
BIOS Date: 10/16/01
BIOS Signon: unknown
BIOS Type: PhoenixBIOS 4.0 Release 6.0 licensed to Intel
Super I/O: unknown
Chipset: Intel 440BX/ZX rev 1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is quite different then the actual BIOS in use on the
host operating system. </p>
<p>As well there are a number of utilities to make a copy of the
bios, BIOS Wizard is available for free and can easily make a
copy of the system bios, considering that the BIOS VMware uses is
relatively unique it becomes quite easy to check a signature of
the BIOS file to see if it is a VMware BIOS. Unfortunately there
is almost no way to hide this information from a savvy attacker,
making it an Achilles' heel for VMware honeypot systems. Both
these utilities are available from: <a href="http://www.bioscentral.com/misc/downloads.htm">http://www.bioscentral.com/misc/downloads.htm</a>.
There is a utility for Linux and BSD at: <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/">http://www.cgsecurity.org/</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Potential legal pitfalls</h2>
<p>Since VMware proxies system calls and provides access to the
hardware mediated through the host operating system it is
critical that the host operating system be secure. It is likely
that a defense lawyer will argue that the evidence was tainted by
the host operating system, or perhaps directly modified from the
host operating system without trace, among several possible
problems. Access to the host operating system must be strictly
controlled and activities logged, it is also probably a good idea
to establish that common activities on the guest operating system
can not or do not taint potential evidence, e.g. disk
defragmentation would rearrange the virtual disk files, modifying
the data. Access to other guest systems must also be regulated,
if you are planning to use the results of a VMware honeypot as
evidence it is probably best to only run one guest operating
system per machine, although it is unlikely that guest operating
systems could conflict or modify each other the potential does
exist for a defense lawyer to cast doubt. </p>
<p>One major factor that could also cause a case to fall apart is
if the guest operating system was given access to the host
operating system's file system. This can be done via VMware, or
could also be accomplished via network file sharing protocols
such as SMB (Windows) or NFS (UNIX), ftp, http, peer to peer file
sheering applications and so on. The host operating system must
be secured, and access tightly limited. It is also advisable to
turn on as much logging and auditing as possible on the host
operating system in case any question do arise. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>VMware is an invaluable tool for investigators wishing to
deploy honeypots for research purposed, or as early warning
devices. But like most complex tools it can end up creating a lot
of unneeded work, or even maiming your foot if you are not
careful. Fortunately VMware is relatively straightforward to use,
and there are a number of simple techniques that will make life
much easier when performing a forensic analysis of a honeypot
running under VMware. </p>
