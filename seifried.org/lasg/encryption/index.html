<h2>Encrypting data files and email</h2>
<p>Several encryption programs are also available to encrypt your
data, some at the file level (PGP, GnuPG, etc.) and some at the
drive level (Cryptographic File System for example). These
systems are very appropriate for the storage of secure data, and
to some degree for the transmission of secure data. However both
ends will require the correct software, compatible versions, and
an exchange of public keys will somehow have to take place, which
is unfortunately, an onerous task for most people. In addition to
this you have no easy way of trusting someone's public key unless
you receive it directly from them (such as at a key signing
party), or unless it is signed by someone else you trust (but how
do you get the trusted signer's key securely?). Systems for drive
encryption such as CFS (Cryptographic FileSystem) are typically
easy to implement, and only require the user to provide a
password or key of some form to access their files. There is a
really good article on choosing key sizes at <a href="http://www.cryptosavvy.com/">http://www.cryptosavvy.com/</a>
which raises some issues you probably hadn't considered. I would
recomend reading it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>GnuPG (Gnu Privacy Guard)</h3>
<p>GnuPG is covered in the filesystem section <a href="../filesystem/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>pgp4pine</h3>
<p>pgp4pine is a PGP shell for pine that allows easy usage of
PGP/GnuPG from within pine. Signing / encrypting and so on is
made easier. You can get it from: <a href="http://pgp4pine.flatline.de/">http://pgp4pine.flatline.de/</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Netscape Messenger</h3>
<p>Netscape Messenger supports X.509 certificates, as do most
Windows mailer programs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sources of random data</h2>
<p>In order for encryption to be effective, especially on a large
scale such as IPSec across many hosts, good sources of random,
cryptographically secure data are needed. In Linux we have
/dev/random and /dev/urandom which are good but not always great.
Part of the equation is measuring 'random' events, manipulating
that data and then making it available (via (u)random). These
random events include: keyboard and mouse input, interrupts,
drive reads, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as many servers have no keyboard/mouse, and new
&quot;blackbox&quot; products often contain no harddrive, sources
of random data become harder to find. Some sources, like network
activity, are not entirely appropriate because the attacks may be
able to measure it as well (granted this would be a very exotic
attack, but enough to worry people nonetheless). There are
several sources of random data that can be used (or at least they
appear random), radioactive decay and radio frequency
manipulations are two popular ones. Unfortunately the idea of
sticking a radioactive device in a computer makes most people
nervous. And using manipulated radio frequencies is prone to
error, and the possibility of outside manipulation. For most of
us, this isn&#146;t a real concern, however for IPSec gateway
servers handling many connections it can be a problem. One
potential solution is the PIII, which has a built in random
number generator that measures thermal variance in the CPU, I
think as we progress, solutions like this will become more
common.</p>
