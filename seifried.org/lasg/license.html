<h1>License and Warranty</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenContent (OC) is defined as the set of webpages
comprising the &quot;Linux Administrator's Security Guide&quot;
(primary location at <a href="http://seifried.org/lasg/">http://seifried.org/lasg/</a>).
The OpenContent license is available from <a href="http://www.opencontent.org/">http://www.opencontent.org/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>LICENSE</b></p>
<p>Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying</p>
<p>Items other than copying, distributing, and modifying the
Content with which this license was distributed (such as using,
etc.) are outside the scope of this license.</p>
<p>1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the
OpenContent (OC) as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the OC
a copy of this License along with the OC. You may at your option
charge a fee for the media and/or handling involved in creating a
unique copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your option
offer instructional support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or
you may at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You
may not charge a fee for the OC itself. You may not charge a fee
for the sole service of providing access to and/or use of the OC
via a network (e.g. the Internet), whether it be via the world
wide web, FTP, or any other method.</p>
<p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or
any portion of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p>a) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed it, the exact nature and content
of the changes, and the date of any change.</p>
<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the OC or
any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise
permitted under applicable Fair Use law.</p>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works
in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to
those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is
a work based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on
the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it. Exceptions are made to this
requirement to release modified works free of charge under this
license only in compliance with Fair Use law where applicable.</p>
<p>3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
copy, distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited
by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
distributing or translating the OC, or by deriving works
herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
translating the OC.</p>
<p><b>NO WARRANTY</b></p>
<p>4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC &quot;AS
IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY,
INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p>5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MIRROR AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
