<p>I don't know how many times I can tell people, but it never
ceases to amaze me how often people are surprised by the fact
that if they do not backup their data it will be gone, if the
drive suffers a head crash on them or they hit 'delete' without
thinking. Always backup your system, even if it's just the config
files, you'll save yourself time and money in the long run. This
is even on the SANS top 20 list.</p>
<p>To backup your data under Linux there are many solutions, all
with various pro's and con's. There are also several industrial
strength backup programs, the better ones support network backups
which are a definite plus in a large non-homogenous environment.</p>
<p>One of the other critical things to remember with backups is
that whoever has access to them (backup admin, cleaning staff)
will have access to all your files unless you encrypt the
backups. Physically securing backups is critical, damaging
backups physically so they cannot be recovered is extremely easy,
with magnetic media simply place a strong magnet near them, for
CD's simply scratching the surface or cracking the CD will
prevent usage. You should also keep a relatively recent set of
backups offsite in case the building burns down or is
inaccessible for some other reason (such as a chemical spill). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Non-commercial backup programs for Linux</h2>
<p>There are numerous non commercial backup programs for Linux
ranging from simple tools suitable for saving a few files to
professional multi-system network backups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tar and Gzip or Bzip2</h3>
<p>Oldies but still goldies, tar and gzip. Why? Because like vi
you can darn near bet the farm on the fact that any UNIX system
will have tar and gzip. They may be slow, klunky and starting to
show their age, but it's a universal tool that will get the job
done. I find with Linux the installation of a typical system
takes 15-30 minutes depending on the speed of the network/cdrom,
configuration another 5-15 (assuming I have backups or it is very
simple) and data restoration takes as long as it takes
(definitely not something you should rush). Good example: I
recently backed up a server and then proceeded to blow the
filesystem away (and remove 2 physical HD's that I no longer
needed), I then installed Red Hat 5.2, and reconfigured all 3
network cards, Apache (for about 10 virtual sites), Bind and
several other services in about 15 minutes. If I had done it from
scratch it would have taken me several hours. Simply:</p>
<pre>tar -cvf archive-name.tar dir1 dir2 dir3....</pre>
<p>to create the tarball of all your favorite files (typically
/etc, /var/spool/mail/, /var/log/, /home, and any other
user/system data), followed by a:<br>
gzip -9 archive-name.tar<br>
to compress it as much as possible (granted harddrive space is
cheaper then a politicians promise but compressing it makes it
easier to move around). You might want to use bzip2, which is
quite a bit better then gzip at compressing text, but it is quite
a bit slower. I typically then make a copy of the archive on a
remote server, either by ftping it or emailing it as an
attachment if it's not too big (e.g. the backup of a typical
firewall is around 100k or so of config files).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>rsync</h3>
<p>rsync is an ideal way to move data between servers. It is very
efficient for maintaining large directory trees in synch (not
real time mind you), and is relatively easy to configure and
secure. rsync does not encrypt the data however so you should use
something like SSH or IPSec if the data is sensitive (SSH is
easiest, simply use &quot;-e ssh&quot;). rsync is <a href="../network-servers/file-print/rsync.html">covered here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Amanda</h3>
<p>Amanda is a client/server based network backup programs with
support for most unices and Windows (via SAMBA). Amanda is BSD
style licensed and available from: <a href="http://www.amanda.org/">http://www.amanda.org/</a>.
Amanda now ships standard with a number of distributions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Commercial backup programs for Linux</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>BRU</h3>
<p>BRU (Backup and Restore Utility), has been in the Linux world
since as long as Linux Journal (they have had ads in there since
the beginning as far as I can tell). This program affords a
relatively complete set of tools in a nice unified format, with
command line and a graphical front end (easy to automate in other
words). It supports full, incremental and differential backups,
as well as catalogs, and can write to a file or tape drive,
basically a solid, simple, easy to use backup program. BRU is
available at <a href="http://www.tolisgroup.com/products3.html">http://www.tolisgroup.com/products3.html</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Quickstart</h3>
<p>Quickstart is more aimed at making an image of the system so
that when the hard drive fails/etc. you can quickly re-image a
blank disk and have a working system. It can also be used to
'master' a system and then load other systems quickly (as an
alternative to say Red Hat's KickStart). It's reasonably priced
as well and garnered a good revue in Linux Journal (Nov 1998,
page 50). You can get it at: <a href="http://www.tolisgroup.com/products3.html">http://www.tolisgroup.com/products3.html</a>.

<h2>Backup media</h2>
<p>There are more things to back data up onto than you can drive
a range rover over but here are some of the more popular/sane
alternatives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top">Name of Media</td>
<td valign="top">Pro's</td>
<td valign="top">Con's</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Hard Drive</td>
<td valign="top">It's fast. It's cheap. It's huge (160
gigs). It's pretty reliable. ($2-$3 USD per gig)&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">It might not be big enough, and they do
fail, usually at the worst possible time. Harder to take
offsite as well. RAID is a viable option though. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">CDROM&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">Not susceptible to EMP, and everyone in
the developed world has a CDROM drive. Media is also
pretty sturdy and cheap ($0.20 USD per 650 Megs or so)</td>
<td valign="top">CDROM's do have a finite shelf life of
5-15 years, and not all recordables are equal. Keep away
from sunlight, and make sure you have a CDROM drive that
will read them. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Tape&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">It's reliable, you can buy BIG tapes,
tape carousels and tape robots, but they're not very
cheap. </td>
<td valign="top">Magnetic media, finite life span and
some tapes can be easily damaged (you get what you pay
for), also make sure the tapes can be read on other tape
drives (in case the server burns down....).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Floppies&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">I'm not kidding, there are rumors some
people still use these to backup data.</td>
<td valign="top">It's a floppy. They go bad and are very
small. Great for config files though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Zip Disks</td>
<td valign="top">I have yet to damage one, nor have my
cats. They hold 100 megs which is good enough for most
single user machines.</td>
<td valign="top">Not everyone has a zip drive, and they
are magnetic media. The IDE and SCSI models are passably
fast, but the parallel port models are abysmally slow.
Watch out for the click of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Jazz Drives</td>
<td valign="top">1 or 2 gig removable hard drives, my
SCSI one averages 5 meg/sec writes.</td>
<td valign="top">They die. I'm on my third drive. The
platters also have a habit of going south if used
heavily. And they aren&#146;t cheap. They are junk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">LS120&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">120 Megs, and cheap, gaining in
popularity (hah, I actually believed that). These things
are dead as far as I can tell. </td>
<td valign="top">Slow. I'm not kidding. 120 megs over a
floppy controller to something that is advertised as
&quot;up to 3-4 times faster then a floppy drive&quot;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Printer&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">Very long shelf life. requires a
standard Mark 1 human being as a reading device. Handy
for showing consultants and as reference material. Cannot
be easily altered.</td>
<td valign="top">You want to retype a 4000 entry password
file? OCR is another option as well.</td>
</tr>
