<p>Linux (or GNU/Linux according to Stallman if you&#146;re
referring to a complete distribution) is actually just the kernel
of the operating system. The kernel is the core of the system, it
handles access to the harddrive, security mechanisms, networking
and pretty much everything. It had better be secure or you are
screwed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to this we have hardware problems like the Pentium
F00F bug, and problems inherent to the TCP-IP protocol, the Linux
kernel has it&#146;s work cut out for it. Kernel versions are
labeled as X.Y.Z, Z are minor revision numbers, Y define whether
the kernel is a test (odd number) or production (even number),
and X defines the major revision (we have had 0, 1 and 2 so far).
I would highly recommend running kernel 2.2.x, as of December
1999 this is 2.2.13. The 2.2.x series of kernel has major
improvements over the 2.0.x series. Using the 2.2.x kernels also
allows you access to newer features such as ipchains (instead of
ipfwadm) and other advanced security features. The 2.0.x series
has also been officially discontinued as of June 1999. To find
out what the latest kernel(s) are simply finger
@linux.kernel.org:</p>

<h2><a name="Compiling and installing a kernel:">Compiling and
installing a kernel:</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upgrading the kernel consists of getting a new kernel and
modules, editing /etc/lilo.conf, rerunning LILO to write a new
MBR. The kernel will typically be placed into /boot, and the
modules in /lib/modules/kernel.version.number/.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting a new kernel and modules can be accomplished 2 ways,
by downloading the appropriate kernel package and installing it,
or by downloading the source code from <a href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/">ftp://ftp.kernel.org/</a> (please
use a mirror site), and compiling it.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>cd /usr/src</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>there should be a symlink called &#147;linux&#148; pointing to
the directory containing the current kernel, remove it if there
is, if there isn&#146;t one no problem. You might want to
&#147;mv&#148; the linux directory to
/usr/src/linux-kernel.version.number and create a link pointing
/usr/src/linux at it.</p>
<p>Unpack the source code using tar and gzip as appropriate so
that you now have a /usr/src/linux with about 50 megabytes of
source code in it. The next step is to create the linux kernel
configuration (/usr/src/linux.config), this can be achieved using
&#147;make config&#148;, &#147;make menuconfig&#148; or
&#147;make xconfig&#148;, my preferred method is &#147;make
menuconfig&#148; (for this you will need ncurses and ncurses
devel libraries). This is arguably the hardest step, there are
hundreds options, which can be categorized into two main areas:
hardware support, and service support. For hardware support make
a list of hardware that this kernel will be running on (i.e.
P166, Adaptec 2940 SCSI Controller, NE2000 Ethernet card, etc.)
and turn on the appropriate options. As for service support you
will need to figure out which file systems (fat, ext2, minix
,etc.) you plan to use, the same for networking (firewalling,
etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have configured the kernel you need to compile it,
the following commands makes dependencies ensuring that libraries
and so forth get built in the right order, then cleans out any
information from previous compiles, then builds a kernel, the
modules and installs the modules.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>make dep		#(makes dependencies)
make clean	#(cleans out previous cruft)
make bzImage	#(make zImage pukes if the kernel is to big, and 2.2.x kernels tend to be pretty big)
make modules	#(creates all the modules you specified)
make modules_install	#(installs the modules to /lib/modules/kernel.version.number/)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You then need to copy /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage
(or zImage) to /boot/vmlinuz-kernel.version.number. Then edit
/etc/lilo.conf, adding a new entry for the new kernel and setting
it as the default image is the safest way (using the default=X
command, otherwise it will boot the first kernel listed), if it
fails you can reboot and go back to the previous working kernel.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
default=linux
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.9
	label=linux
	root=/dev/hda1
	read-only
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.5
	label=linuxold
	root=/dev/hda1
	read-only</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have finished editing /etc/lilo.conf you must run
/sbin/lilo to rewrite the MBR (Master Boot Record). When LILO
runs you will see output similar to:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Added linux *
Added linuxold</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It will list the images that are listed on the data in the MBR
and indicate with a * which is the default (typically the default
to load is the first image listed, unless you explicitly specify
one using the default directive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Kernel versions">Kernel versions</a></h2>
<p>Currently the stable kernel release series is 2.4.x, and the
development series is 2.5.x. The 2.3.x development series of
kernels is not recommended, there are many problems and
inconsistencies. The 2.2.x series of kernel while old and lacking
some features is relatively solid, unfortunately the upgrade from
2.2.x to 2.4.x is a pretty large step, I would advise caution.
Several software packages must be updated, libraries, ppp,
modutils and others (they are covered in the kernel docs / rpm
dependencies / etc.). Additionally keep the old working kernel,
add an entry in lilo.conf for it as &quot;linuxold&quot; or
something similar and you will be able to easily recover in the
event 2.2.x doesn't work out as expected. Don't expect the 2.4.x
series to be bug free, flaws will be found and older versions
will become obsolete, like every piece of software in the world.</p>
<p>There are a variety of kernel level patches that can enhance
the security of a Linux system. Some prevent buffer overflow
exploits, other provide strong crypto.</p>
