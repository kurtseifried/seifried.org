<p>Many security problems arise from the simple fact that you
must allow user access to your systems. In some cases users can
be malicious (i.e. internal attacker, university students, etc.)
or they may accidentally expose their password to an attacker or
simply use a weak password (like their username). In any event it
is all to possible for users to attack a system, so it is
advisable to monitor users, and limit the amount of damage they
can do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Limiting users">Limiting users</a></h2>
<p>Users require resources like CPU time, memory and drive space
to do their work. On many systems it is possible for users to hog
resources, reducing the usefulness of the system to other users
or in some cases actually bringing the server to a slow halt or
crashing it. Users can also inadvertently use up more resources
then they mean to, limiting their resources can prevent several
classes of problems. Programs can crash. generating huge core
dumps, or go crazy and user up all the available memory.
Something to remember: global limits apply to root, so be
careful! If you do not allow root to run enough processes for
example cron jobs may fail or you may not even be able to log in
to fix any problems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PAM</h3>
<p>Almost all Linux distributions ship with PAM support making it
universally available. PAM limits provide a single standardized
interface to setting user limits, instead of having to write
complex shell configuration files (such as /etc/profile) you
simply edit the &quot;limits.conf&quot; file. As well applying
limits selectively through the command shell is very difficult,
whereas with PAM applying limits globally, on groups or on
individual users is quite simple. Documentation is available on
PAM usually in the &quot;/usr/share/doc/&quot; tree. To enable
PAM limits you need to add a line such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>session		required	/lib/security/pam_limits.so</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>to the appropriate Pam configuration file (i.e.
/etc/pam.d/sshd). You can then define limits, typically these are
in &quot;/etc/security/limits.conf&quot; or a similar location.
Because most of these limits are enforced by the shell the system
cannot log all violations of limits (i.e. you will be notified in
syslog when a user exceeds the number of times they are allowed
to login, however you will not receive a warning if the user
tries to use more disk space then they are allowed to). </p>
<p>The available limits are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>core</b> -- Limits the core file size (KB); usually set
to 0 for most users to prevent core dumps.<br>
<b>data</b> -- Maximum data size (KB).<br>
<b>fsize</b> -- Maximum file size (KB).<br>
<b>memlock</b> -- Maximum locked-in-memory address space
(KB).<br>
<b>nofile</b> -- Maximum number of open files.<br>
<b>rss</b> -- Maximum resident set size (KB).<br>
<b>stack</b> -- Maximum stack size (KB).<br>
<b>cpu</b> -- Maximum CPU time (MIN).<br>
<b>nproc</b> -- Maximum number of processes.<br>
<b>as</b> -- Address space limit.<br>
<b>maxlogins</b> -- Maximum number of logins for this user or
group.<br>
<b>priority</b> -- The priority to run user process with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example you can limit the amount of memory that user
&quot;bob&quot; is allowed to use:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>user		hard	memlock		4096</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This would place a hard (absolute) limit of 4 megabytes on
memory usage for &quot;bob&quot;. Limits can be placed on users
by listing the user name, groups by using the syntax
&quot;@group&quot; or globally by using &quot;*&quot;.</p>
<p>core files can be created when a program crashes. They have
been used in security exploits, overwriting system files, or by
containing sensitive information (such as passwords). You can
easily disable core dumps using PAM, and generally speaking most
users will not notice, however if you have software developers
they may complain.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>*		hard	core		0</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>fsize is generally a good idea to set, many users will have a
large filesystem quota (i.e. tens of megabytes to several hundred
or several gigabytes), however if they are allowed to create a
single file that is abnormally large they can easily hog disk I/O
resources (i.e. create a large file and copy/delete the copy
repeatedly). Setting this limit globally can also prevent an
attacker from trying to fill up the partitions your log files are
stored on, for example if you only have a single / partition an
attacker can easily fill it up by generating a lot of log events.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>@notroot	hard	data		102400</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course limiting CPU time is one of the classic
administrative tasks, this is very useful for preventing run-away
processes from eating up all the cpu time, and it ensures that if
a user leaves something running in background (such as a packet
sniffer) it will eventually be killed. Limiting CPU time will
have several side effects however, once of which will be limiting
the amount of time a user can spend logged in (eventually they
will run out of CPU time and the session will be killed), this
can lead to problems if users spend long periods logged in. As
well depending on the CPU(s) present in your machine the limits
can vary greatly (one minute on a 386 is quite a bit different
then one minute on a 1.3 GHz Athalon). </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>@students	hard	cpu		2</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Limiting the number of times a user can login is strongly
advised, for most situations users should not need to log in to a
server more then once, and allowing them to do so let's them use
more resources then you might intend. As well it can be used to
detect suspicious activity, if users know they can only login
once then attempts to log in multiple times can be viewed as
suspicious activity (i.e. an attacker with a stolen password
trying to access the account). </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>@users		hard	maxlogins	1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally when someone violated this limit it will be
logged in syslog:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Apr 15 15:09:26 stench PAM_unix[9993]: (sshd) session opened for user test by (uid=0)
Apr 15 15:09:32 stench pam_limits[10015]: Too many logins (max 1) for test</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Soft limit violations will not be logged (i.e. a soft limit of
1 and a hard limit of 2). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bash</h3>
<p>Bash has built in limits, accessed via &#147;ulimit&#148;. Any
hard limits cannot be set higher, so if you have limits defined
in /etc/profile, or in the users .bash_profile (assuming they
cannot edit/delete .bash_profile) you can enforce limits on users
with Bash shells. This is useful for older Linux distributions
that lack PAM support (however this is increasingly rare and PAM
should be used if possible). You must also ensure that the user
cannot change their login shell, if they use &quot;chsh&quot; to
change their shell to ksh for example the next time they login
they will have no limits (assuming you cave not put limits on
ksh). Documentation is available on ulimit, log in using bash and
issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>[<a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="65170a0a1125160017130017">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> /root]# <strong>help ulimit</strong>
ulimit: ulimit [-SHacdflmnpstuv] [limit]
    Ulimit provides control over the resources available to processes
    started by the shell, on systems that allow such control.  If an
    option is given, it is interpreted as follows:
    
        -S      use the `soft' resource limit
        -H      use the `hard' resource limit
        -a      all current limits are reported
        -c      the maximum size of core files created
        -d      the maximum size of a process's data segment
        -f      the maximum size of files created by the shell
        -l      the maximum size a process may lock into memory
        -m      the maximum resident set size
        -n      the maximum number of open file descriptors
        -p      the pipe buffer size
        -s      the maximum stack size
        -t      the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
        -u      the maximum number of user processes
        -v      the size of virtual memory
    
    If LIMIT is given, it is the new value of the specified resource.
    Otherwise, the current value of the specified resource is printed.
    If no option is given, then -f is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte
    increments, except for -t, which is in seconds, -p, which is in
    increments of 512 bytes, and -u, which is an unscaled number of
    processes.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To disallow core files (by setting the maximum size to 0) for
example you would add:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ulimit -Hc 0</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To set limits globally you would need to edit
&quot;/etc/profile&quot;, of course this will also affect root,
so be careful! To set limits on groups you would need to add
scripting to &quot;/etc/profile&quot; that would check for the
user's membership in a group and then apply the statements,
however doing this with PAM is recommended as it is a lot
simpler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Quota</h3>
<p>Quota allows you to enforce user and group limits on disk
usage. Quotas are most often used to prevents users from hogging
disk space that is shared with other users (i.e.
&quot;/home&quot;). There are several benefits to using quota
instead of PAM/shell limitations; the first being that you can
apply it selectively to disk systems, i.e. you can place a limit
on /home/ but not on /tmp/. Additionally you can place limits on
the number of inodes used as well as space, running out of inodes
is as bad as running out of space since you won't be able to
create new files. To see how much space a disk has (in
kilobytes):</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Quota support must be compiled into the kernel (this is the
default with most vendors), and the tools must be installed,
usually in a package called &quot;quota&quot;. Once you have done
this you need to edit your &quot;/etc/fstab&quot; file and add
either the keyword &quot;grpquota&quot; or &quot;usrquota&quot;
in the options:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>LABEL=/		/		ext2    defaults		1 1
LABEL=/home	/home		ext2    defaults,grpquota	1 2</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Then for each filesystem that you have enabled quotas on you
must create two files in the root of the filesystem:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>[<a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="55273a3a2115313c39313a">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> /]# <strong>touch /home/quota.user </strong>
[<a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2a5845455e6a4e43464e45">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> /]# <strong>touch /home/quota.group </strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These files should only be accessible to root. You will then
need to reboot the system.</p>
<p>Typically you will only need to place quota on filesystems
directly writeable to the user, usually this is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/tmp
/var/tmp
/home</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To edit user and group quotas you use the program
&quot;edquota&quot;, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>[<a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="82f0ededf6c2e6ebeee6ed">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> /]# <strong>edquota -u </strong><em><strong>username</strong></em></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will then let you edit the appropriate quota.user or
quota.group file (these files should not be edited directly!).
The editor uses vi by default and the data looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Quotas for user username: 
/dev/hda1: blocks in use: 255, limits (soft = 5120, hard = 10240) 
         inodes in use: 123, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1500)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Soft limits will generate warnings and hard limits will stop
the user from using more disk space or inodes. Documentation on
this can be found in &quot;man quota&quot; or in the Quota
mini-howto available at: <a href="http://www.linux.com/howto/mini/Quota.html">http://www.linux.com/howto/mini/Quota.html</a>.

<h2><a name="Monitoring users">Monitoring users</a></h2>
<p>Monitoring users may be a requirement of your security policy,
or you may have discovered an account that has been compromised
and you wish to monitor the attacker when they use it.
Unfortunately while this used to be relatively easy there are now
a number of new issues that make monitoring users problematic.
The increased usage of encrypted protocols like SSH and SSL mean
you can no longer simply run a packet sniffer and monitor the
attacker. The change in Linux's tty's to pseudo terminals has
&quot;broken&quot; many older software packages as well.
Typically the best way to monitor users is transparently, packet
sniffers are ideal for this as you need not make any changes on
the server at all. The second best is to use some form of
monitoring on the server, this used to be possible with ttysnoop
however ttysnoop does not appear to be actively maintained
anymore. While you can use tricks like shell logging this will be
obvious to a skilled attacker as the first thing they usually do
is disable shell logging. If you are monitoring legitimate users
you should inform them (this is a legal requirement in some
countries and states). If you are monitoring an attacker and
intend to use the log files as evidence you should probably
consult a lawyer to make sure it is done correctly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>sshsniff</h3>
<p>This is actually a really useful tool I stumbled across. It
allows you to monitor all traffic going in and coming out of a
process, such as an interactive shell. The bad news is that it
does not appear to be completely reliable. While testing it
sshsniff reliably captured keystrokes sent to the shell and the
replies, however when files were cat'ed, i.e. &quot;cat
/etc/passwd&quot; the file was not always displayed on the
monitoring shell:</p>

<p>sshsniff is not perfect but it is able to bind to any PID and
not just terminals, making it very flexible. You can download it
from: <a href="http://www.psychoid.lam3rz.de/exploits.html">http://www.psychoid.lam3rz.de/exploits.html</a>.
One note there is a file called col.c that contains an entry for
/etc/passwd, it does not appear to be used but it does raise some
questions. If you plan to use this code I strongly suggest you
audit it.</p>

<h3>dsniff</h3>
<p>With protocols like SSH and SSL being widely deployed simple
packet sniffers are no longer as useful as they once were. So
people started writing more complex packet sniffers, like dsniff.
dsniff is capable of doing man in the middle attacks against SSL
and SSH. If you control the server then you can easily proxy
connections (as you have access to the secret keys on the server)
and thus decrypt the attackers SSH session and monitor what is
going on. dsniff is not capable of dealing with all version of
the SSH protocol however, so forcing only protocol 1 support on
the server can solve this, in your sshd_config file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Protocol 1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>is specified and not:</p>
<blockquote>

<h3>Firewalling</h3>
<p>One new capability in Linux 2.4 that should prove quite useful
is the ability to filter some types of outgoing packet based on
who owns the process that created them. Of course this is not
100% effective as some types of packets are not owned ny anyone

<pre>--uid-owner
--gid-owner
--pid-owner
--sid-owner</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>which are discussed in more detail in the firewall section,
documentation is available via &quot;man iptables&quot;.</p>
