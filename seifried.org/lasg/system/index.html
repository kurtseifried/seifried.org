<p>While the majority of random and remote attacks come in over
the network physical and console security are important factors.
In a perfect world every machine would be physically secure with
access to the console (i.e. keyboard, reset switch and monitor)
tightly controlled. Unfortunately this is not a perfect world it
is rare to find a physically secure machine outside of a server
room. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Physical-security">Physical security</a></h2>
<p>Remember that an attacker may not want to break into your
desktop machine or network, they may be looking for a quick way
to make $200, and stealing a desktop computer is one way to do
that. All systems should be securely fastened to something with a
cable system, or locked in an equipment cage if possible. Case
locks should be used when possible to slow attackers down (thefts
of ram and CPU's are becoming increasingly popular). Some
systems, like Apple G4&#146;s, when cable locked cannot be
opened, if you need machines for public areas features like this
are ideal. For secure rooms make sure that the walls go beyond
the false ceiling, and below the raised floor, large vents should
also be covered with bars if possible. Monitoring the room with
CCTV and possibly requiring a remote person to &quot;buzz&quot;
you in (in addition to a lock, keypad or other access control
device) is recommended. </p>
<p>With enough time and physical access an attacker will be able
to gain access to the system, several methods of attack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebooting the system from other media such as floppy
disk, CD-ROM, external SCSI drives and so on</li>
<li>Removing the case, and removing the BIOS battery to get
around any BIOS restrictions</li>
<li>Using a default BIOS password to gain access to the BIOS</li>
<li>Rebooting the system and passing boot arguments to LILO</li>
<li>Installing physical monitoring devices such as KeyGhost</li>
<li>Stealing the system&#146;s disk(s)</li>
<li>Unplug the server, or turn the power bar off (a very
effective DoS), if done several times this can lead to
filesystem corruption. </li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of many possible attacks. The primary
goal is to stop them where possible, and failing that slow them
down so that hopefully someone will notice the attacker tearing
apart a system in someone&#146;s office. The installation of
monitoring devices is becoming especially worrisome, as they are
now available for purchase online for less then $100. An attacker
can easily log all keystrokes for a long time period before the
attacker comes back to retrieve them. Periodic physical
inspections (in teams of two) of user machines for items like
KeyGhost, modems are so on are a good idea. </p>
<p>Gaining access to office buildings is often trivial. While
working for the government there was no access control to the
building itself from 8 A.M. until 5 P.M. (after 5 P.M. a security
guard forced you to sign in). Worse yet the building had a back
entrance that was not monitored. If you were to enter at 4:30
P.M., hide in a bathroom for an hour or two (crouched on top of a
toilet reading the latest Linux Journal) you could easily spend
several hours fiddling with desktop systems and leave at your
convenience without being seen by anyone. Cleaning staff also
never questioned me when I stayed late (and conversely I never
questioned them), you should train staff to approach people they
do not recognize and ask them politely if they need assistance or
are lost. While access to buildings cannot often be controlled
effectively (to many entrances / different tenants / etc.) you
can control access to your floor, a locked door with a CCTV
monitoring it after hours is often a good deterrent. </p>
<p>&quot;Practical Unix and Internet Security&quot; from O'Reilly
covers physical problems as well and is definitely worth buying. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Console-security">Console security</a></h2>
<p>With physical access to most machines you can simply reboot
the system and ask it nicely to launch into single user mode, or
tell it to use /bin/sh for init. You can enter the BIOS and tell
the machine to boot from a floppy, doing a quick end run around
most security. Alternatively you can simply enter the bios,
disable the IDE controllers, put a password on the BIOS,
rendering the machine largely unusable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>BIOS / Open Firmware security</h3>
<p>Assuming the attacker does not steal the entire machine the
first thing that they will usually try is to reboot the system
and either boot from a floppy disk (or other removable media). If
they can do this then any standard file protection is useless,
the attacker declares themselves to be root, mounts the
filesystem and gains complete access to it. </p>
<p>To secure a x86 BIOS you typically enter it by hitting
&quot;delete&quot; or a function key during the boot process, the
actual name and location of the BIOS password varies
significantly, look for &quot;security&quot; or
&quot;maintenance&quot;. There are usually different levels of
password protections, on some motherboards you can disable the
keyboard until a password is typed in (the BIOS intercepts and
blocks input until it sees the password entered on the keyboard),
on others it only prevents accessing the BIOS. Generally speaking
you want to block access to the BIOS, and lock the boot sequence
to the first internal storage device (i.e. the first IDE disk or
SCSI). </p>
<p>Even if you do everything right there are still some ways for
an attacker to subvert the boot process. Many older BIOS&#146;s
have universal passwords, generally speaking this practice has
declined with modern systems, but you may wish to inquire with
the vendor. Another potential problem to be aware of is that many
add-on IDE and SCSI controller cards have their own BIOS, from
which you can check the status of attached devices, choose a boot
device, and in some cases format attached media. Many high-end
network cards also allow you to control the boot sequence,
letting you boot from the network instead of a local disk. This
is why physical security is critical for servers. Other
techniques include disabling the floppy drive so that attackers
or insiders cannot copy information to floppy and take it
outside. You may also wish to disable the serial ports in users
machines so that they cannot attach modems, most modern computers
use PS/2 keyboard and mice, so there is very little reason for a
serial port in any case (plus they eat up IRQ's). Same goes for
the parallel port, allowing users to print in a fashion that
bypasses your network, or giving them the chance to attach an
external CD-ROM burner or harddrive can decrease security
greatly. As you can see this is an extension of the policy of
least privilege and can decrease risks considerably, as well as
making network maintenance easier (less IRQ conflicts, etc.).
There are of course programs to get the BIOS password from a
computer, one is available <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/">http://www.cgsecurity.org/</a>,
it is available for DOS and Linux.</p>
<p>If you decide to secure the BIOS&#146;s on systems you should
audit them once in a while if possible, simply reboot the machine
and try to boot off of a floppy disk or get into the BIOS. If you
can then you know someone has changed settings on the system, and
while there may be a simple explanation (a careless technician
for example) it may also be your first warning that an attack has
occurred. There are several programs for Linux that allow an
attacker with root access to gain the BIOS password, while this
is a rather moot point it does bear mentioning (if an attacker
has gained root access they can already do pretty much anything).
</p>
<p>To secure a Sparc or UltraSparc boot prom send a break during
boot-up, hit stop-a, and you should be presented with the ok&gt;
prompt. Setting your password is a simple matter of using the
password command and typing the password in twice. You will then
want to set the security-mode, using &quot;setenv&quot; from the
default of none to command at the very least, and full if you are
security conscious (warning, you will need the password to boot
the machine). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ok
ok <strong>password</strong>
ok New password (only first 8 chars are used):<strong>*****</strong>
ok Retype new password: <strong>*****</strong>
ok
ok <strong>setenv security-mode </strong><em><strong>full</strong></em>
ok</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also set &quot;security-mode&quot; to
&quot;command&quot; which will require the password to access the
open firmware but is less strict then &quot;full&quot;. Do not
lose this password, especially if you set the security-mode to
full, as you may need to replace the PROM to recover the system.
You can wipe the password by setting &quot;security-mode&quot; to
&quot;none&quot;. </p>
<p>Unfortunately if you are using Apple hardware you cannot
secure the boot process in any meaningful manner. While booting
if the user holds down the command-option-P-R keys it will wipe
any settings that exist, there is no way to avoid this. About the
only security related option you can set is whether the machine
automatically reboots or not, this is useful for servers to
prevent a remote attacker from changing the kernel for example
(which require a system reboot). Hold down the command-option-O-F
keys to access the OpenFirmware and from there you need to:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>go&gt; <strong>setenv auto-boot? False</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>However because a local attacker can easily flush the settings
there is no inherent security. If you need to use Apple systems
as servers then it is highly advisable to lock them in a cabinet
of some sort. As workstations in a public area your best solution
is to automate the reloading of the OS to speed recover time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LILO security</h3>
<p>LILO is the Linux boot loader, it handles all the nitty gritty
tasks of getting the kernel into memory and bootstrapping them
machine into something that resembles a useful computing device.
LILO handles many things, from telling the kernel to look for
multiple network cards to how much memory there is (assuming
Linux won&#146;t detect how much your system has). There are
several options you can pass to LILO to bypass most any account
security or console security. </p>
<p>Booting Linux into single user mode with (assuming the label
is &quot;linux&quot;):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><strong>linux single</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will dump you into a root level command prompt on many
systems. From there you can simply add a new users with UID 0,
format the disks or copy Trojan&#146;ed binaries off a floppy
disk. One way many vendors deal with this is by using sulogin,
single user login, which prompts for root&#146;s password before
letting you on. This will prevent people from accessing single
user mode and getting directly to a root prompt however there is
a another attack. You can specify which program will be used to
init the system, instead of the default init you can use a
command shell:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><strong>init=/bin/sh</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Which will present you with a root prompt. The best way to
defeat this and the single mode problem are to secure LILO and
prevent the passing of boot arguments without a password. Many
people argue that this somehow inhibits normal use of the system,
however there should be no need normally for the user booting the
system to pass LILO arguments (if an argument is needed at boot
time it should be put into lilo.conf permanently). Generally
speaking the only time you will need to pass LILO arguments is
when something on the system breaks, at which point it&#146;s
probably wise to send out a technician who knows the password to
fix the system. </p>
<p>To secure LILO you must set a password, and use the restricted
keyword. You can also set security on a per image basis, or on
LILO as a whole. If you set security on a per image basis you
will be able to tell LILO which image you wish to boot without
needing a password, but you will not be able to pass the kernel
arguments such as &quot;single&quot;. If you set security on LILO
as a whole then you will only be able to boot to the default
image, specifying a different image will require the password.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
message=/boot/message
linear
default=linux

password=thisisapassword
restricted

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.18
	label=linux
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda1

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17
	label=linux-old
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be cumbersome, however it does prevent attackers from
booting a different image. </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
message=/boot/message
linear
default=linux

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.18
	label=linux
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda1
	password=thisisapassword
	restricted

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17
	label=linux-old
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda1
	password=thisisapassword
	restricted</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The above example will prevent attackers from messing with the
&quot;linux&quot; and &quot;linux-old&quot; image, however if
they need to boot the old kernel (because a driver is broken, or
SMP support doesn&#146;t work quite right) then they will not
need the password to do so.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of security you want you can either
restrict and password protect all of LILO, or just the individual
images. In any event if you are deploying workstations or servers
you should use one to prevent users from breaking into systems in
less than 10 seconds. While things like sulogin will prevent a
user from getting a root prompt if they enter single user mode
the attacker can always use &quot;init=/bin/sh&quot;.</p>
<p>One minor security measure you can take to secure the
lilo.conf file is to set it immutable, using the
&#147;chattr&#148; command. To set the file immutable simply run
the following command as root:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><strong>chattr +i /sbin/lilo.conf</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>and this will prevent any changes (accidental or otherwise) to
the lilo.conf file. If you wish to modify the lilo.conf file you
will need to unset the immutable flag run the following command
as root:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><strong>chattr -i /sbin/lilo.conf</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>only the root user has access to the immutable flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Grub security</h3>
<p>Grub is the default boot loader in Debian, Mandrake and
possibly Red Hat 7.2. More on this to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Rebooting the system</h3>
<p>If possible you should make rebooting the system more
difficult, by default almost all Linux distributions have
ctrl-alt-del enabled so that it reboots the machines. However,
unlike Windows, this is not necessary. In Linux you can easily
control the behavior of ctrl-alt-del, simply by editing the
/etc/inittab file:</p>
<pre>ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now</pre>
<p>You may wish to disable it entirely (simply comment it out
with a #) or modify the command issued. Minimally you can create
a bash script such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>#!/bin/bash
#
# This script emails a message to root and then shuts 
# down the system after a 5 second delay
#
/bin/date | /bin/mail &#150;s &quot;ctrl-alt-del used&quot; root
/bin/sleep 5s
/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now every time someone hits ctrl-alt-del you will have an
email message in root&#146;s account logging it. You can also
send that email to another system (i.e. to <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="1d6f7272695d78657c706d717833726f7a">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>). If
you do this you may wish to introduce a small delay between the
mail command and the shutdown command to ensure the email gets
out before the mail system is turned off. Of course an attacker
can always hit the reset switch, power button, unplug the system,
or trip the breakers for an entire floor of computers. If the
system is in a locked cabinet however this is quite a bit more
conspicuous then simply using a three finger salute
(ctrl-alt-del) to reboot the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>An attacker with physical access to the console, or worse yet
the hardware itself has many potential avenues of attack they can
pursue. Worse yet if their goal is to simply deny use of service,
or damage the software and hardware doing so is trivial. Flipping
the power off and on during the boot process will often result in
drive corruption, or they can simply pour a glass of water into
the power supply. Locking servers up in secure rooms is critical,
a competitor can easily afford to pay a janitor several thousand
dollars to turn a server off, and pour pop into the power supply,
resulting in a dead server when staff turns it back on.
Workstations are typically more vulnerable as they are in
accessible areas, but hopefully they are interchangeable with
another workstation, with all data being stored on servers. </p>
