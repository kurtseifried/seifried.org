<p>Linux is not as susceptible to viruses in the same ways that a
Dos/Windows or Mac platform is. In UNIX, security controls are a
fundamental part of the operating system. For example users are
not allowed to write promiscuously to any location in memory that
they choose to, something that Dos/Windows and the Mac
allow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be fair there are viruses for UNIX. However the only Linux
one I have seen was called &quot;bliss&quot;, had an uninstall
option (&quot;--uninstall-please&quot;) and had to be run as root
to be effective. Or to quote an old Unix favorite &quot;if you
don't know what an executable does, don't run it as root&quot;.
Worms are much more prevalent in the UNIX world, the first major
occurrence being the Morris Internet worm which exploited a
vulnerability in sendmail. Current Linux worms exploit broken
versions of imapd, sendmail, WU-FTPD and other daemons. The
simplest fix is to keep up to date and not make daemons
accessible unless necessary. These attacks can be very successful
especially if they find a network of hosts that are not up to
date, but typically their effectiveness fades out as people
upgrade their daemons. In general I would not specifically worry
about these two items, and there is definitely no need to buy
anti-virus software for Linux.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worms have a long and proud tradition in the UNIX world, by
exploiting known security holes (generally, very few exploit
new/unknown holes) and replicating they can quickly mangle a
network(s). There are several worms currently making their way
around Linux machines, mostly exploiting old Bind 4.x and old
IMAP software. Defeating them is as easy as keeping software up
to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trojan horses are also popular. Recently ftp.win.tue.nl was
broken into and the TCP_WRAPPERS package (among others) was
modified to email passwords to an anonymous account. This was
detected when someone checked the PGP signature of the package
and found that it wasn't quite kosher. Moral of the story? Use
software from trusted sites, and check the PGP signature(s).</p>

<h2><a name="Disinfection of viruses / worms / trojans">Disinfection
of viruses / worms / trojans</a></h2>
<p>Back up your data, format and reinstall the system from known
good media. Once an attacker has root on a Linux system they can
literally do anything, from compromising gcc/egcs to loading
interesting kernel modules at boot time. Do not run untrusted
software as root. Check the PGP signatures on files you download,
etc. An ounce of prevention will pretty much block the spread of
viruses, worms and trojans under Linux.</p>
<p>The easiest method for dealing with viruses and the like is to
use system integrity tools such as tripwire, L5, and
Gog&amp;Magog, you will be able to easily find which files have
been compromised and restore/replace/update them. There are also
many Anti-Virus scanners available for Linux (but generally
speaking there aren&#146;t any Linux viruses).</p>

<h2><a name="Virus Scanners for Linux">Virus Scanners for Linux</a></h2>
<p>As stated above viruses aren&#146;t a real concern in the
Linux world, however virus scanners that run on Linux can be
useful. Filtering email / other forms of content at the gateways
to your network (everyone has Windows machines) can provide an
extra line of defense since the platforms providing the defense
against the threat cannot be compromised by that threat
(hopefully). You may also wish to scan files stored on Linux file
servers that are accessed by Windows clients. Luckily there are
several good anti-virus programs available for Linux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sophos Anti-Virus</h3>
<p>Sophos Anti-Virus is a commercial virus scanner that runs on a
variety of Windows and UNIX platforms. It is free for personal
use and relatively inexpensive for commercial use. You can get it
at: <a href="http://www.sophos.com/">http://www.sophos.com/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>AntiVir</h3>
<p>AntiVir is another commercial virus scanner that runs on a
variety of Windows platforms and Linux. You can get it from: <a href="http://www.hbedv.com/">http://www.hbedv.com/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>InterScan VirusWall</h3>
<p>Trend Micro has ported this product to Linux and offers it for
free download on their site. You can get it from: <a href="http://www.antivirus.com/products/isvw/">http://www.antivirus.com/products/isvw/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>F-Secure Anti-Virus</h3>
<p>Data Fellow's has ported their anti-virus scanner to Linux as
well. You can get it at: <a href="http://www.datafellows.com/products/">http://www.datafellows.com/products/</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>AVP</h3>
<p>Kaspersky lab's has also ported their anti-virus scanner over
to Linux, currently in beta, available at: <a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/products.asp">http://www.kaspersky.com/products.asp</a>

<p>Also see the <a href="../network-servers/email/index.html">email
server section</a> for setting up <a href="../network-servers/email/index.html">virus
scanning of incoming email</a> (very useful if you have windows
clients).</p>
