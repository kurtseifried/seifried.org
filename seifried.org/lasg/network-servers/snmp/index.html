<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) was designed to let
heterogeneous systems and equipment talk to each other, report
data and allow modifications to there settings over a TCP-IP
network. For example an SNMP enabled device (such as a Cisco
router) can be monitored/configured from an SNMP client, and you
can easily write scripts to, say, alert you if denied
packets/second rises above 20. Unfortunately SNMP has no security
built into it. SNMPv1, originally proposed in RFC 1157 (May 1990)
and section 8 (Security Considerations) reads thusly:
&quot;Security issues are not discussed in this memo.&quot;. I
think that about sums it up. In 1992/1993 SNMPv2 was released,
and did contain security considerations however these security
considerations were dropped later on when they were shown to be
completely broken. Thus we end up today with SNMPv2 and no
security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently the only way to protect your SNMP devices consists
of setting the community name to something hard to guess (but it
is very easy to sniff the wire and find the name), and
firewall/filter SNMP so that only the hosts that need to talk to
each other can (which leaves you open to spoofing). Brute force
community name attacks are easy to do and usually effective, and
there are several tools specifically for monitoring SNMP
transmissions and cracking open an SNMP community, it is a pretty
dangerous world out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These risks are slightly mitigated by the usefulness of SNMP,
if properly supported and implemented it can make network
administration significantly easier. In almost every SNMP
implementation the default community name is &quot;public&quot;
(this goes for Linux, NT, etc), you must change this, to
something obscure (your company name is a bad idea). Once a
person has your community name they can conduct an
&quot;snmpwalk&quot; and take over your network. SNMP runs over
UDP on ports 161 and 162; block this at all entrances to your
network (the backbone, the dialup pool, etc). If a segment of
network does not have SNMP enabled devices or an SNMP console you
should block SNMP to and from that network. This is your only
real line of defense with SNMP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally the use of IPSec (or other VPN software) can
greatly reduce the risk from sniffing. The RFC's for SNMPv3
however go extensively into security (especially RFC 2274, Jan
1998) so there is hope for the future. If you are purchasing new
SNMP aware/enabled products make sure they support SNMPv3, as you
then have a chance at real security.</p>
<p>There are no specific problems with cu-snmpd per se, apart
from the general SNMP problems I have covered. The cu-snmp tools
and utilities only support SNMPv1 and SNMPv2, so remember to be
careful when using them on or across untrusted networks as your
main line of security (the community name) will be out in the
open for anyone to see.</p>
