<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>WWW traffic is one of the largest components of Internet usage
today. There are a variety of popular WWW servers for Linux, the
most popular of course being Apache (with over %50 of the
market). Most modern WWW servers also have the capability to use
SSL to secure sessions (for e-commerce and so on). This section
is very Apache-centric, but since this is the default www server
for almost all Linux (and *BSD) distributions it makes sense. I'm
also writing for the 1.3.9 version of Apache which no longer uses
access.conf or srm.conf, but instead has rolled everything into
httpd.conf.</p>
<p>HTTP runs on port 80, tcp, and if it is for internal use only
(an Intranet, or www based control mechanism for a firewall
server say) you should definitely firewall it.</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 80
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 80
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 80</pre>
<p>or in ipchains:</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 80
ipchains -A input -p all -j ACCEPT -s some.trusted.host -d 0.0.0.0/0 80
ipchains -A input -p all -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 80</pre>
<p>HTTPS runs on port 443, tcp, and if it is for internal use
only (an Intranet, or www based control mechanism for a firewall
server say) you should definitely firewall it.</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 443
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 443
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 443</pre>
<p>or in ipchains:</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 443

<h2><a name="WWW server software">WWW server software</a></h2>
<h2><a name="Apache">Apache</a></h2>
<p>What can I say about securing Apache? Not much actually. By
default Apache runs as the user 'nobody', giving it very little
access to the system, and by and large the Apache team has done
an excellent job of avoiding buffer overflows/etc. In general
most www servers simply retrieve data off of the system and send
it out, most of the danger come not from Apache but from sloppy
programs that are executed via Apache (CGI's, server side
includes, etc).</p>
<p>If going with Apache, I would recommend using the 1.3 series
unless you have some strange requirement for sticking to 1.2, the
active development is now on 1.3, and includes many new features
from security, usability, stability and performance viewpoints.
Most servers based upon Apache (Red Hat Secure Server,
Stronghold, etc.) are generally just as bug free but there are
occasionally problems. You can download Apache from <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">http://httpd.apache.org/</a>.
Almost all distributions ship with it, so you should have it as
package or whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Chroot'ing Apache</strong></p>
<p>If you want to be paranoid I would suggest running Apache in a
chroot'ed environment, this however is sometimes more trouble
then it is worth. Doing this will break a great many things. You
must also install numerous libraries, Perl, and any other
utilities that your Apache server will be using, as well as any
configuration files you wish to have access to. Any CGI scripts
and other things that interact with the system will be somewhat
problematic and generally harder to troubleshoot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simplest way to setup Apache chroot'ed is to simply
install it and move/edit the necessary files. A good idea is to
create a directory (such as /chroot/apache/), preferably on a
separate filesystem from /, /usr, /etc (hard links, accidental
filling of partitions, etc...), and then create a file structure
under it for Apache. The following is an example, simply replace
/chroot/apache/ with your choice. You must of course execute
these steps as root for it to work. RPM supports this with the
&#147;--root /some/dir&#148; directive, simply install Apache and
the needed libs using rpm (thus gaining it's support for
dependencies/etc, making your life easier). If you are not on an
RPM based system simply use ldd to find out which shared
libraries are required, and move everything needed into your
/chroot/apache/ directory.</p>

<p>Apache logs requests and so forth internally, so you don't
have to worry about setting up pseudo logging daemons like
holelogd to pass information to syslog in order to get your log
files behaving.</p>
<h2>Secure configuration of Apache</h2>
<p>About the simplest way to secure Apache and insure that it
doesn't have unnecessary access to your filesystem is to create a
/www/ or similar directory and place ALL the websites, web
content, cgi's and so forth under it. Then you can simply set
access.conf up to deny any access to /, and enable access to
/www/ and its various cgi-bin directories.</p>
<p>Example for httpd.conf:</p>
<pre>&lt;Directory /&gt;
Options None
AllowOverride None
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;Directory /www &gt;
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
AllowOverride None
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
<p><strong>Controlling access</strong></p>
<p>Access to directories can also be controlled easily, Apache
supports the defining and placement of files (usually referred to
as htaccess files) that can control access based on username and
password, IP of origin, and so forth. This is defined in
srm.conf:</p>
<pre>AccessFileName .htaccess</pre>
<p>The format of this file is covered in the Apache
documentation, and is identical to directives you would place in
access.conf (well almost). User authentication via username and
password is also covered in depth at: <a href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth">http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you also want to prevent people from viewing the .htaccess
file(s), place this in your srm.conf:</p>
<pre>&lt;Files .htaccess&gt;&nbsp;
order allow,deny&nbsp;
deny from all&nbsp;
&lt;/Files&gt;&nbsp;</pre>
<p>This will disallow the viewing of any file called '.htaccess'.</p>
<p><strong>apache-userdirldap</strong></p>
<p>apache-userdirldap allows you to use an LDAP directory for
looking up user home directories. In other words if you want to
move all your users into an LDAP directory and do ALL
authentication through it, you won't have to break Apache. You
can get it at: <a href="http://horde.net/~jwm/software/apache-userdirldap/">http://horde.net/~jwm/software/apache-userdirldap/</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="thttpd">thttpd</a></h2>
<p>A lightweight http server suitable for web based interfaces
and the like (Phoenix Adaptive firewall uses it for htier
interface for example). You can get it at: <a href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/">http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="AOL Server">AOL Server</a></h2>
<p>I know, it sounds strange but it is true. AOL Server is a free
www server, with source code available. Not only that but it
supports SSL and several other advanced features. Definitely
worth taking a look at. You can get it from: <a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com/</a>.</p>
<p>There is more to securing your www server then installing
Apache and configuring it properly. Most servers will need to
allow access to their filesystems so that users can upload and
modify files on the server. For this there are 4 widely used
methods that I will cover in detail.</p>
<h2><a name="webfs">webfs</a></h2>

<h2><a name="Secure WWW server software">Secure WWW server
software</a></h2>
<p>There are several free alternatives for Apache with SSL, and
several commercial ones. If you are located in the US, RSA is
patented, so you either have to use DSA (which is hard to get
site certificates for) or buy a commercial server based on Apache
(like Stronghold). If you are located in Europe you may live in a
country where IDEA is patented, so make sure you check first.
There are also a variety of commercial packages. I have also
written two article covering the various secure www servers:</p>
<p>Web server round up articles need to be put back online,
please email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#49223c3b3d093a2c202f3b202c2d67263b2e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="99f2ecebedd9eafcf0ffebf0fcfdb7f6ebfe">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></a>
to remind me about this.</p>
<h2><a name="Apache-SSL">Apache-SSL</a></h2>
<p>This is the one I currently use (simple because I tried it
before Apache with mod_ssl, and it worked). You need to get
Open-SSL, compile and install that, and then patch Apache with
the Apache-SSL patch, compile Apache, and off you go. Open-SSL is
available from: <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>,
simply get the latest tarball, unpack it, and run:</p>
<pre>./config
make
make test
make install  </pre>
<p>It hasn't ever failed for me yet. You then need get the
Apache-SSL stuff from <a href="http://www.apache-ssl.org/">http://www.apache-ssl.org/</a>,
unpack the Apache source somewhere, cd into the top level dir
(/usr/local/src/apache_1.3.9/) and then unpack the Apache-SSL
stuff into it (it tells you to do this in the docs, sort of a
catch 22). You then simply run:</p>
<pre>./FixPatch</pre>
<p>Which should work (if it doesn't read the README.SSL), then
configure Apache as usual, and run make, followed by make
install. Skip down to the &quot;Creating a certificate&quot;
section.</p>
<h2><a name="Apache with mod_ssl">Apache with mod_ssl</a></h2>
<p>Apache with mod_ssl is available from <a href="http://www.modssl.org/">http://www.modssl.org/</a>. I
haven't tested it yet.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a certificate</strong></p>
<p>This is the easy part, the next step is to create a key set,
and then configure httpsd.conf to use it appropriately. Find
where &quot;openssl&quot; is installed and make sure it is in
your path, then cd to wherever you placed your apache config
files (whatever you prefixed as the apache root followed by
/conf/). If you need to create a test certificate, simply to use
internally then you can:</p>
<pre>openssl genrsa -des3 &gt; httpsd.key
openssl req -new -x509 -key httpsd.key &gt; httpsd.crt</pre>
<p>Browsers will complain loudly about this certificate because
it is created by the person who signs it, and they are untrusted.
If you want to generate a certificate, and a certificate request
to send to someone like Thawte or Verisign then you need to:</p>
<pre>openssl genrsa -des3 &gt; httpsd.key
openssl req -new -key httpsd.key &gt; httpsd.csr</pre>
<p>You can also get real certificates with limited life times
(usually a week or two) from Verisign to use for testing in a
more &quot;real world&quot; environment.</p>
<p><strong>Configuring Apache for SSL</strong></p>
<p>There are several things you will need to add to your Apache
config file to get Apache with SSL extensions actually doing
anything useful with your certificates. You'll need to add some
global configuration settings (note these apply to 1.3.9, and
will barf on earlier versions of Apache):</p>
<pre># you will need to tell apache to listen to port 443, by default it only goes for 80
Listen 443
# if you use more then one secure site on an IP (BAD IDEA) you will need:
NameVirtualHost 10.1.1.1:443
#it's a good idea to disable SSL globally and enable it on a per host basis
SSLDisable 
# SSL cache server, without this your server will die
SSLCacheServerPath /usr/bin/gcache
# port the cache server runs on
SSLCacheServerPort 12345
# timeout for the SSL cache, set shorter for testing, 300 is a good &quot;real world&quot; value
SSLSessionCacheTimeout 300</pre>
<p>Now you can create a virtual host with SSL enabled:</p>
<pre>&lt;VirtualHost www.example.com:443&gt;
DocumentRoot /www/secure/
ServerName www.example.com
ServerAdmin <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="adc8d5ccc0ddc1c8edc8d5ccc0ddc1c883cec2c0">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>
ErrorLog logs/https_error.log

# enable SSL for this virtual host

<h2><a name="Red Hat Secure Server">Red Hat Secure Server</a></h2>
<p>Red Hat Secure Server is an Apache based product from (guess
who) Red Hat software. Essentially it is stock Apache with RSA
cryptographic modules (which is what you are paying for
essentially) and can also serve standard non cryptographic http
requests. It can only be sold in the USA and Canada, and is the
best option (in my opinion) as far as secure www servers that are
legal to use in the US go (due to RSA patents). As far as
security goes read the previous section on Apache / Apache-SSL,
it all applies. Red Hat Secure Server costs $100 US and you get a
$25 discount on your Thawte site certificate (so the site
certificate only costs $100 US). I personally like it a lot as it
is based on software that runs over half the www sites in the
world and as such getting support/updates/etc. is easy. You can
buy Red Hat Secure Server from: <a href="http://store.redhat.com/apps/commerce/">http://store.redhat.com/apps/commerce/</a>
</p>
<h2><a name="Roxen">Roxen</a></h2>
<p>Roxen is another commercial www server capable of https and is
GPL licensed. You can freely download it if you are in the
European Union or Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway,
USA, or Switzerland. A version with &#147;weak&#148; (40 bit)
crypto can be downloaded without any problems to any country.
Roxen is an extremely solid product and is available from: <a href="http://www.roxen.com/">http://www.roxen.com/</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Zeus">Zeus</a></h2>

fine) for Linux, available from: <a href="http://www.iplanet.com/download_index/downloads_index_9_0.html">http://www.iplanet.com/download_index/downloads_index_9_0.html</a>
</p>
<h2><a name="IBM HTTP Server">IBM HTTP Server</a></h2>
<p>IBM also makes an HTTP server for Linux (based on Apache) that
you can download from here: <a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/download.html">http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/download.html</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Accessing your WWW server files">Accessing your WWW
server files</a></h2>
<p>At some point you will need to access the files on the www
server to update them. Logging in and using a text editor like
emacs is not usually a good long term decision if you value your
time. Several popular HTML authoring packages can access your
website via FTP or windows file sharing.</p>
<h2><a name="FTP">FTP</a></h2>
<p>This is the &#147;classic&#148; method of granting users
access to ftp servers, typically concerns include users viewing
each others data, viewing system data they should not, and so
forth. Chroot&#146;ing the users ftp session will solve most of
these problems, however the main problem with ftp, as for
encrypting the username and password this is typically undoable
due to the fact most people are running Windows FTP clients. I
would recommend ProFTPD over WU-FTPD for an application such as
this, ProFTPD has much better access controls.</p>
<h2><a name="Samba access">Samba access</a></h2>
<p>Samba is quite useful for sharing out the www directories to
Windows clients, you can then keep the usernames and passwords
separate from the system (using smbpasswd rather then the system
passwd) and encryption of logins is no problem. Simply make the
shares non browseable, and use the &#147;valid users&#148;
directive to restrict which users may view the share data. For
example:</p>
<pre>[www-example]
	path = /www/www.example.org/
	valid users = someuser
	read only = No
	browseable = No</pre>
<p>will setup a pretty secure share for the directory
&#147;/www/www.example.org/&#148; that only the user
&#147;example&#148; can access.</p>
<h2><a name="FrontPage access">FrontPage access</a></h2>
<p>FrontPage is one of the most popular HTML programs for Windows
users (heck, I even use it). It can talk directly to WWW servers
and download / upload files from a site (called a &#147;FrontPage
Site&#148;) if the server supports FrontPage extensions.
FrontPage extensions are available for various UNIX platforms,
for free, from Ready To Run Software, at: <a href="http://www.rtr.com/Ready-to-Run_Software/">http://www.rtr.com/Ready-to-Run_Software/</a>
. In the past, security wise, RTR&#146;s FrontPage extensions for
UNIX have been a bit of a disaster. There are commercial
alternatives however, one is Instant ASP, available from: <a href="http://www.halcyonsoft.com/">http://www.halcyonsoft.com/</a>.
An excellent document on getting FrontPage working with Apache
1.3.X is available at: <a href="http://www.itma.lu/howto/apache/">http://www.itma.lu/howto/apache/</a>.
