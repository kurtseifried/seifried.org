<p>There are a variety of proxy software packages for Linux. Some
are application level (such as SQUID) and others are at the
session level (such as SOCKS).</p>

<h2><a name="SQUID">SQUID</a></h2>
<p>SQUID is a powerful and fast object cache server. It proxies
FTP and WWW sessions, basically giving it many of the properties
of an FTP and a WWW server, but it only reads and writes files
within it's cache directory (or so we hope), making it relatively
safe. Squid would be very hard to use to actually compromise the
system and runs as a non root user (typically 'nobody'), so
generally it's not much to worry about. Your main worry with
Squid should be improper configuration. For example, if Squid is
hooked up to your internal network (as is usually the case), and
the internet (again, very common), it could actually be used to
reach internal hosts (even if they are using non-routed IP
addresses). Hence proper configuration of Squid is very
important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simplest way to make sure this doesn't happen is to use
Squid's internal configuration and only bind it to the internal
interface(s), not letting the outside world attempt to use it as
a proxy to get at your internal LAN. In addition to this,
firewalling it is a good idea. Squid can also be used as an HTTP
accelerator (also known as a reverse proxy), perhaps you have an
NT WWW Server on the internal network that you want to share with
the world, in this case things get a bit harder to configure but
it is possible to do relatively securely. Fortunately Squid has
very good ACL's (Access Control Lists) built into the squid.conf
file, allowing you to lock down access by names, IP&#146;s,
networks, time of day, actual day (perhaps you allow unlimited
browsing on the weekends for people that actually come in to the
office). Remember however that the more complicated an ACL is,
the slower Squid will be to respond to requests.</p>
<p>Most network administrators will want to configure Squid so
that an internal network can access www sites on the Internet. In
this example 10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0 is the internal network,
5.6.7.8 is the external IP address of the Squid server, and
1.2.3.4 is a www server we want to see.</p>
<p>Squid should be configured so that it only listens for
requests on it&#146;s internal interface, if it were listening on
all interfaces I could go to 5.6.7.8 port 3128 and request
http://10.0.0.2/, or any internal machine for that matter and
view www content on your internal network. You want something
like this in your squid.conf file:</p>
<pre>tcp_incoming_address 10.0.0.1
tcp_outgoing_address 5.6.7.8
udp_incoming_address 10.0.0.1
udp_outgoing_address 5.6.7.8</pre>
<p>This will prevent anyone from using Squid to probe your
internal network.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the coin we have people that use Squid
to make internal www servers accessible to the Internet in a
controlled manner. For example you may want to have an IIS 4.0
www server you want to put on the Internet, but are afraid to
connect it directly. Using Squid you can grant access to it in a
very controlled manner. In this example 1.2.3.4 is a random
machine on the Internet, 5.6.7.8 is the external IP address of
the Squid server, 10.0.0.1 is it&#146;s internal IP address, and
10.0.0.2 is a www server on the internal network running IIS 4.0.</p>
<p>To set Squid up to run as an accelerator simply set the
&#147;http_port&#148; to 80 in squid.conf:</p>
<pre>http_port 3128</pre>
<p>And then set the IP addresses differently:</p>
<pre>tcp_incoming_address 5.6.7.8
tcp_outgoing_address 10.0.0.2
udp_incoming_address 5.6.7.8
udp_outgoing_address 10.0.0.2</pre>
<p>And finally you have to define the machine you are
accelerating for:</p>
<pre>httpd_accel_host 10.0.0.2
httpd_accel_port 80</pre>
<p>This is covered extensively in the Squid FAQ at: <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ.html</a>
(section 20).</p>
<p>The ACL's work by defining rules, and then applying those
rules, for example:</p>
<pre>acl internalnet 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
http_access allow internalnet
http_access deny all</pre>
<p>Which defines &quot;internalnet&quot; as being anything with a
source of 10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0, allowing it access to the http
caching port, and denying everything else. Remember that rules
are read in the order given, just like ipfwadm, allowing you to
get very complex (and make mistakes if you are not careful).
Always start with the specific rules followed by more general
rules, and remember to put blanket denials after specific
allowals, otherwise it might make it through. Its better to
accidentally deny something then to let it though, as you'll find
out about denials (usually from annoyed users) faster then things
that get through (when annoyed users notice accounting files from
the internal www server appearing on the Internet). The Squid
configuration files (squid.conf) is well commented (to the point
of overkill) and also has a decent man page.</p>
<p>Another useful example is blocking ads, so to block them you
can add the following to squid.conf:</p>
<pre>acl ads dstdomain ads.blah.com
http_access deny ads</pre>
<p>The acl declaration is simply a pattern, be it a destination
domain name, source domain name, regex and so on, the http_access
directive actually specifies what to do with it (deny, allow,
etc). Properly setup this is an extremely powerful tool to
restrict access to the WWW. Unfortunately it does have one
Achilles heel: it doesn't support user based authentication and
control (not that many UNIX based proxy servers do). Remember
that like any set of rules they are read from top to bottom, so
put your specific denials and allowals first, and then the more
general rules. The squid.conf file should be well commented and
self explanatory, the Squid FAQ is at: <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ.html</a>
</p>
<p>One important security issue most people overlook with Squid
is the log files it keeps. By default Squid may or may not log
each request it handles (depends on the config file), from
&#147;http://www.nsa.gov/&#148; to
&#147;http://www.example.org/cgi-bin/access&amp;member=john&amp;password=bob&#148;.
You definitely want to disable the access logs unless you want to
keep a close eye on what people view on the Internet (legally
this is questionable, check with your lawyers). The directive is
&#147;cache_access_log&#148; and to disable it set it to
&#147;/dev/null&#148;, this logs ALL accesses, and ICP queries
(inter-cache communications). The next big one is the
&#147;cache_store_log&#148;, which is actually semi useful for
generating statistics on how effective your www cache is, it
doesn&#146;t log who made the request, simply what the status of
objects in the cache is, so in this case you would see the
pictures on a pornographic site being repeatedly served, to
disable it set it to &#147;none&#148;. The &#147;cache_log&#148;
should probably be left on, it contains basic debugging info such
as when the server was started and when it was stopped, to
disable it set it to &#147;/dev/null&#148;. Another, not very
well documented log files is the &#147;cache_swap_log&#148; file,
which keeps a record of what is going on with the cache, and will
also show you the URL&#146;s people are visiting (but not
who/etc), setting this to &#147;/dev/null&#148; doesn&#146;t work
(in fact Squid pukes out severely) and setting it to
&#147;none&#148; simply changes the filename from &#147;log&#148;
to &#147;none&#148;. The only way to stop it is to link the file
to &#147;/dev/null&#148; (by default the root of the www cache
files /log), and also to link the &#147;log-last-clean&#148; to
&#147;/dev/null&#148; (although in my quick tests it doesn&#146;t
appear to store anything you can&#146;t be sure otherwise). So to
summarize:</p>
<p>in squid.conf:</p>
<pre>cache_access_log /dev/null
cache_store_log none
cache_log /dev/null</pre>
<p>and link:</p>
<pre>/var/spool/squid/log to /dev/null
/var/spool/squid/log-last-clean to /dev/null</pre>
<p>or whichever directory holds the root of your www cache (the
00 through 0F directories).</p>
<p>Another important issue that gets forgotten is the ICP
(Internet Cache Protocol) component of Squid. The only time you
will use ICP is if you create arrays or chains of proxy servers.
If you&#146;re like me, you have only the one proxy server and
you should definitely disabled ICP. This is easily done by
setting the ICP port in squid.conf from the default
&#147;3130&#148; to &#147;0&#148;. You should also firewall port
3128 (the default Squid port that clients bind to) from the
Internet:</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 3128
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 3128
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 3128</pre>
<p>or in ipchains:</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 3128
ipchains -A input -p all -j ACCEPT -s some.trusted.host -d 0.0.0.0/0 3128
ipchains -A input -p all -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 3128</pre>
<p><strong>squidGuard</strong></p>
<p>squidGuard allows you to put in access control lists, filter
lists, and redirect requests, easily and efficiently. It is ideal
for controlling access to the WWW, and for more specific tasks
such as blocking pornographic content (a valid concern for many
people). It cannot make decisions based upon content however, it
simply looks at the URL&#146;s being processed, so it cannot be
used to block active content and so on. squidGuard is available
from: <a href="http://www.squidguard.org">http://www.squidguard.org</a>
</p>
<p><strong>LDAP auth module for SQUID</strong></p>
<p>This allows you to authenticate users via an LDAP server,
however passwords/etc are transmitted in the clear, so use some
form of VPN to secure it. You can get it from: <a href="http://www.stroeder.com/proxy_auth_ldap/">http://www.stroeder.com/proxy_auth_ldap/</a>
</p>
<h2><a name="Cut the crap">Cut the crap</a></h2>
<p>Cut the crap (CTC) is aimed at blocking banner ads and
reducing bandwidth usage while surfing. You can get it from: <a href="http://www.softlab.ece.ntua.gr/~ckotso/CTC/">http://www.softlab.ece.ntua.gr/~ckotso/CTC/</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="WWWOFFLE">WWWOFFLE</a></h2>
<p>WWWOFFLE is a rather nice looking proxy for UNIX systems that
handles HTTP and FTP. You can get it at: <a href="http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/">http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Circuit level proxy software">Circuit level proxy
software</a></h2>
<h2><a name="SOCKS">SOCKS</a></h2>
<p>SOCKS is a circuit level proxy, typically loaded on firewalls
because it has good access controls. Applications must be
SOCKS'ified, most popular web browsers, ftp clients and so on
have support by default. You can get it from: <a href="http://www.socks.nec.com/">http://www.socks.nec.com/</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Dante">Dante</a></h2>
<p>Dante is a free implementaiton of the popular SOCKS server. It
is available from: <a href="http://www.inet.no/dante/">http://www.inet.no/dante/</a>.</p>
