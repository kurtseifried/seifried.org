<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>There are a variety of services that can provide information
about local users to other local users, and other machines. These
can be useful if you want to find out which user connected to a
machine, or see when they last logged in. Of course these are
great services for attackers since they can glean a lot of
information from them.</p>
<h2><a name="Ident server software">Ident server software</a></h2>
<p>The ident service is used to map users/processes to ports in
use. For example most IRC servers attempt to find out who is
connecting to them by doing an ident lookup, which basically
consists of asking the ident server on the client computer what
information it has about a port number, and the response can
range from nothing (if no-one is using that particular port) to a
username, groupname, process id, and other interesting
information. The default setting in most distributions is that
identd is on (it is polite to run it, irc servers and newer
versions of sendmail check identd responses), and will only hand
out the username. The primary use of identd is to allow remote
systems some means of tracking down users that are connecting to
their servers, irc, telnet, mail, or other, for authentication
purposes (not a good idea since it is very easy to fake). The
local university here in Edmonton requires you to run identd if
you want to telnet into any of the main shell servers, primarily
so they can track down compromised accounts quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running identd on your machine will help other administrators
when tracking down problems, as they can not only get the IP
address and time of a problem, but using identd can look up the
user name. In this way it is a two edged sword, while it gives
out information useful for tracking down malicious users
(definitely people you want to boot off of your servers) it can
also be used to gain information about users on your system,
leading to their accounts being compromised. Running identd on
servers only makes sense if they are hosting shell accounts/etc.</p>
<p>Identd runs on port 113 using tcp, and typically you will only
need if you want to IRC (many irc networks require an identd
response), or be nice to systems running daemons (such as
tcp_wrapped telnet, or sendmail) that do identd lookups on
connections.</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 113
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 113
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 113</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 113
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s some.trusted.host -d 0.0.0.0/0 113
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 113</pre>
<h2><a name="Identd">Identd</a></h2>
<p>Identd supports quite a few features, and can be easily set to
run as a non-root user. Depending on your security policies you
may not want to give out very much information, or you might want
to give out as much as possible. Simply tack the option on in
inetd.conf, after in.identd (the defaults are -l -e -o).</p>
<p>-p port<br>
-a address<br>
Can be used to specify which port and address it binds to (in the
case of a machine with IP&#146;s aliased, or multiple
interfaces), this is generally only useful if you want internal
machines to connect, since external machines will probably not be
able to figure out what port you changed it to.</p>
<p>-u uid<br>
-g gid<br>
Are used to set the user and group that identd will drop its
privileges to after connecting to the port, this will result in
it being far less susceptible to compromising system security. As
for handling the amount of information it gives out:</p>
<p>-o<br>
Specifies that identd will not return the operating system type,
and simply say &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;, a very good option.</p>
<p>-n<br>
Will have identd return user numbers (i.e. UID) and not the
username, which still gives them enough information to tell you
and allow you to track the user down easily, without giving
valuable hints to would be attackers.</p>
<p>-N<br>
Allows users to make a ~/.noident file, which will force identd
to return &quot;HIDDEN-USER&quot; instead of information. This
allows users the option of having a degree of privacy, but a
malicious user will use this to evade identification.</p>
<p>-F format<br>
Enables you to specify far more information than is standard,
everything from user name and number to the actual PID, command
name, and command name and arguments that were given! This I
would recommend only for internal use, as it is a lot of
information that attackers would find useful.</p>
<p>In general I would advise running identd on servers with user
shell accounts, and otherwise disabling it, primarily due to the
number of denial of service attacks it is susceptible to. Running
identd will make life a lot easier for other administrators when
tracking down attacks originating from your site, which will
ultimately make your life easier.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Other Identd daemons">Other Identd daemons</a></h2>
<p>There are also other versions of identd available, some with
security enhancements (I do not endorse these as I have yet to
test them):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tildeslash.org/nullidentd.html">http://www.tildeslash.org/nullidentd.html</a>
- null identd<br>

<h2><a name="Finger server software">Finger server software</a></h2>
<p>Finger is one of those things most admins just disable and
ignore. It is a useful tool on occasion, but if you want to allow
other admins to figure out which of your users is currently
trying to crack their machines, use identd. Finger lets out way
to much info, and is a favorite tool for initial probes and data
gathering on targets. There have also been several nasty DOS
attacks released, basically consisting of sending hundreds of
finger requests and in certain configurations just watching the
server croak. Please don't run finger. Many distributions ship
with it enabled, but to quote inetd.conf from Red Hat:</p>
<pre># Finger, systat and netstat give out user information which may be
# valuable to potential &quot;system crackers.&quot; Many sites choose to disable&nbsp;
# some or all of these services to improve security.</pre>
<p>If you still have the urge that you absolutely must run it use
-u to deny finger @host requests that are only ever used to
gather information for future attacks. Disable finger, really.
Fingerd has also been the cause of a few recent and very bad
denial of service attacks, especially if you run NIS with large
maps, DO NOT, repeat NOT run fingerd. Finger runs on port 79, and
cfingerd runs on port 2003, both use tcp.</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 79
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 79
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 79</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 79
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s some.trusted.host -d 0.0.0.0/0 79
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 79</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="PFinger">PFinger</a></h2>
<p>PFinger is similar to Cfingerd in that it is a secure
replacement for the stock fingerd. You can get PFinger from: <a href="http://www.xelia.ch/unix/pfinger/">http://www.xelia.ch/unix/pfinger/</a>.</p>
