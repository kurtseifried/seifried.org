<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is one of the more
important services provided by the Internet. Almost all companies
now have or rely upon email, and by extensions SMTP servers.
There are many SMTP server packages available, the oldest and
most tested is Sendmail (now commercially supported, etc.), and
there are two new contenders, Postfix and Qmail, both of which
were written from scratch with security in mind. Firewalling SMTP
is straightforward, it runs on port 25, TCP:</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 25
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 25
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 25</pre>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 25
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s some.trusted.host -d 0.0.0.0/0 25
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 25</pre>
<pre>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 --dport 25
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -j ACCEPT -s some.trusted.host -d 0.0.0.0/0 --dport 25
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -j REJECT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 --dport 25</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Sendmail">Sendmail</a></h2>
<p>Sendmail has earned itself a very bad reputation for security,
however I find it hard to blame software when I find systems
running ancient versions of Sendmail. The root of the problem (if
you'll pardon a bad pun) is that almost everyone runs Sendmail as
root (and something like %70 of Internet email is handled by
Sendmail machines, so there are a lot of them). As soon as an
exploitable bug is found, finding a system to exploit it on is
not all that hard. The last few releases of Sendmail have been
quite good, no root hacks, etc, and with the new anti-spam
features Sendmail is finally come of age. More information on
Sendmail and source code is available from: <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">http://www.sendmail.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Chroot'ing Sendmail is a good option, but a lot of work, and
since it largely runs as root, rather debatable as to the
effectiveness of this (since root can break out of a chroot'ed
jail). Newer releases of Sendmail from some vendors run less
processes as root, and make it easier to chroot the daemon,
however the last hole in Sendmail on Linux was locally
exploitable and no amount of chroot or non root would have
helped. </p>
<p>Keeping Sendmail up to date is relatively simple, I would
recommend minimally version 8.12.x. More information on 8.12.x is
available at: <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/8.12.1.html">http://www.sendmail.org/8.12.1.html</a>.
Most distributions ship 8.11.x or 8.12.x, and some vendors also
include SMTP auth support, although configuring it can be
difficult (it is poorly documented in most cases). You can also
get the source from but compiling Sendmail is not for the faint
of heart or those that do not have a chunk of time to devote to
it (although building a more up to date version via dpkg or rpm
is possible without to much black magic). The latest version of
sendmail is available from: <a href="ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/">ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Sendmail only needs to be accessible from the outside world if
you are actually using it to receive mail from other machines and
deliver the mail locally. Indeed this is the default with Red
Hat, Sendmail only listens on localhost, allowing you to receive
mail sent locally, and send mail to other systems (however
changing this default can be rather annoying).</p>
<p>If you only want to run Sendmail so that local mail delivery
works (i.e. a stand alone workstation, test server or other) and
so mail can easily be sent to other machines, simply firewall off
Sendmail, or better, do not run it in daemon mode (where it
listens for connections). Sendmail can be run in a queue flushing
node, where it simply 'wakes' up once in a while and processes
local mail, either delivering it locally, or sending it off on
its way across the 'net. To set Sendmail to run in queue mode:</p>
<p>edit your Sendmail startup script<br>
and change the line that has:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sendmail -bd -q1h</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sendmail -q1h</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Please note: if you use your system to send lots of email you
may wish to set the queue flush time lower, perhaps
&#147;-q15m&#148; (flush the queue every 15 minutes) now outbound
and system internal mail will behave just fine, which unless you
run a mail server, is perfect.</p>
<p>Now for all those wonderful anti-spam features in sendmail.
Sendmail's configuration files consist of (this applies to
Sendmail 8.9.x):</p>
<p>/etc/sendmail.cf&nbsp;<br>
Primary config file, also tells where other config files are.</p>
<p>/etc/mail/<br>
You can define the location of configuration files in
sendmail.cf, typically people place them in /etc/ or /etc/mail/
(which makes it a little less cluttered).</p>
<p>access<br>
Access list database, allows you to reject email from certain
sources (IP or domain), and control relaying easily. My access
file looks like this:</p>
<pre>10.0.0 RELAY
spam.com REJECT</pre>
<p>which means 10.0.0.* (hosts on my internal network) are
allowed to use the email server to send email to wherever they
want, and that all email to or from *.spam.com is rejected. There
are lists online of known spammers, typically they are 5-10,000
entries long, this can seriously impede sendmail performance (as
each connection is checked against this list), on the other hand
having your sendmail machine used to send spam is even worse.</p>
<p>aliases&nbsp;<br>
aliases file, allows you to control delivery of mail local to the
system, useful for backing up incoming user&#146;s email to a
separate spool. Most list serve software uses this file to get
mail sent to lists delivered to the programs that actually
process them. Remember to run the command &#147;newaliases&#148;
after editing this file, and to then restart sendmail.</p>
<p>domaintable&nbsp;<br>
domain table (adding domains) that you handle, useful for virtual
hosting.</p>
<p>majordomo<br>
configuration file for majordomo, I would personally recommend
SmartList over Majordomo.</p>
<p>sendmail.cw<br>
file containing names of hosts for which we receive email, useful
if you host more then one domain.</p>
<p>sendmail.hf<br>
location of help file (telnet to port 25 and type in
&quot;HELP&quot;)</p>
<p>virtusertable&nbsp;<br>
Virtual user table, maps incoming users, i.e. maps
<a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7605171a130536130e171b061a1358190411">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> to <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="305a5f585e705548515d405c551e5f42571e">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></p>
<p>Sendmail 8.9.x (and previous versions) do not really support
logging of all email very nicely (something required in today's
world for legal reasons by many companies). This is one feature
being worked on for the release of Sendmail 8.10.x. Until then
there are 2 ways of logging email, the first is somewhat graceful
and logs email coming IN to users on a per user basis. The second
method is not graceful and involves a simple raw log of all SMTP
transactions into a file, you would have to write some sort of
processor (probably in Perl) to make the log useful.</p>
<p>Mail (incoming SMTP connections to be more precise) is first
filtered by the access file, in here we can REJECT mail from
certain domains/IP&#146;s, and RELAY mail from certain hosts
(i.e. your internal network of windows machines). Any local
domains you actually host mail for will need to go into
sendmail.cw. Assuming mail has met the rules and is queued for
local delivery the next file that gets checked is virtusertable,
this is a listing of email addresses mapped to the account
name/other email address. i.e.:</p>
<pre><a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="0c67797e784c7f69656a7e65696822637e6b">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> alias-seifried
<a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d1bdb8a2a5a4a2b4a391a2b4b8b7a3b8b4b5ffbea3b6">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> listuser
@seifried.org mangled-emails</pre>
<p>The last rule is a catch all so mangled email addresses do not
get bounced, and instead sent to a mailbox. Then the aliases file
is checked, if an entry is found it does what it says to,
otherwise it attempts to deliver the mail to a local users
mailbox, my aliases file entry for seifried is:<br>
alias-seifried: seifried, &quot;/var/backup-spool/seifried&quot;</p>
<p>This way my email gets delivered to my normal mailbox, and to
a backup mailbox (in case I delete an email I really didn't mean
to), or as a worst case scenario, Microsoft Outlook decides to
puke someday and hose my mailboxes. This would also be useful for
corporations, as you now have a backup of all incoming email on a
per user basis, and can allow them (or not) to access the file
containing the backed-up mail.</p>
<p>One caveat, when using a catch-all rule for a domain (i.e.
@seifried.org) you must create an alias for EACH account, and for
mailing lists. Otherwise when it looks through the list and
doesn't find a specific entry (for say <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="234e424a4f4a4d440e4f4a50576350464a45514a46470d4c5144">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>)
it will send it to the mailbox specified by the catch all rule.
For this reason alone you might not wish to use a catch all rule.</p>
<p>The second method is very simple, you simply start sendmail
with the -X option and specify a file to log all transactions to.
This file will grow very large very quickly, I would NOT
recommend using this method to log email unless you absolutely
must.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Relay Authorization Control</strong></p>
<p>Dynamic Relay Authorization Control (DRAC) ties into your
POP/IMAP server to temporarily grant SMTP relay access to hosts
that successfully authenticate and pick up mail (the assumption
being these hosts will send mail, and not abuse this privilege.
You can get it from: <a href="http://mail.cc.umanitoba.ca/drac/index.html">http://mail.cc.umanitoba.ca/drac/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Postfix">Postfix</a></h2>
<p>Postfix is a mail transfer agent (MTA) aimed at security,
speed, ease of configuration, generally things Sendmail fails
miserably at. I would highly recommend replacing Sendmail with
Postfix. The only portion of Postfix that runs as root is a
master control program, aptly called &#147;master&#148;, it calls
several other programs to process mail to the queue
(&#147;pickup&#148;), a program to manage the queue, wait for
incoming connections, deferred mail delivers and so on
(&#147;qmgr&#148;), a program to actually send and receive the
mail (&#147;smtpd&#148;) and so on. Each part of Postfix is very
well thought out, and usually does one or two tasks, very well.
For example instead of the sendmail model where queued mail
simply gets dumped into /var/spool/mqueue, in Postfix there is a
world accessible directory called &#147;maildrop&#148; which is
checked by &#147;pickup&#148;, which feeds the data to
&#147;cleanup&#148; which moves the mail (if it&#146;s properly
formatted and so on) to a secure queue directory for actual
processing.</p>
<p>The primary configuration files are held in /etc/postfix, and
there are several primary configuration files you must have:</p>
<p>master.cf</p>
<p>Controls the behavior of the various &#147;helper&#148;
programs, are they chroot&#146;ed, maximum number of processes
they may run and so forth. It&#146;s probably best to leave the
defaults on most mail servers unless you need to do some tuning
for high loads or securing the server (i.e. chroot&#146;ing it).</p>
<p>main.cf</p>
<p>This file is as close to sendmail.cf as you will get (for
purpose, as for layout it&#146;s quite different). It is well
commented and sets all the major variables, and the locations and
format of various files containing information such as virtual
user mappings and related information.</p>
<p>Here is a list of variables and file locations you will
typically have to set, the /etc/postfix/main.cf file is usually
heavily commented. Please note the following examples of main.cf
entries are not a complete main.cf.</p>
<pre># what is the machines hostname?
myhostname = mail.example.org</pre>
<pre># what is the domain name?
mydomain = example.org</pre>
<pre># what do I label mail as &#147;from&#148;?
myorigin = $mydomain&nbsp;</pre>
<pre># which interfaces do I run on? All of them usually.
inet_interfaces = all</pre>
<pre># a file containing a list of host names and fully qualified domains names I&nbsp;
# receive mail for, usually they are listed like:&nbsp;
# mydestination = localhost, $myhostname, etc
# but I much prefer to keep them listed in a file.
mydestination = /etc/postfix/mydestination</pre>
<pre># map of incoming usernames. &#147;man 5 virtual&#148;
virtual_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual</pre>
<pre># alias mappings (like /etc/aliases in sendmail), &#147;man 5 aliases&#148;
alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases</pre>
<pre># alias database, you might have different settings. &#147;man 5 aliases&#148;
alias_database = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases</pre>
<pre># where to deliver email, Mailbox format or Maildir (traditional /var/spool/mail).
home_mailbox = Maildir/</pre>
<pre># where to keep mail, usually /var/spool/mail/ but you can easily change it
mail_spool_directory = /var/spool/mail</pre>
<pre># what command do we use to deliver email? /usr/bin/procmail is the default but if&nbsp;
# you want to use scanmail which is the AMaViS anti-virus tie in software&nbsp;simply put:
mailbox_command = /usr/sbin/scanmails</pre>
<pre># who do I relay email for, again you can list them, or keep them in a file (one&nbsp;
# per line).
relay_domains = /etc/postfix/relaydomains</pre>
<pre># list of local networks (by default we relay mail for these hosts).
mynetworks = 10.0.0.0/24, 127.0.0.0/8</pre>
<pre># what do we display to people connecting to port 25? By default it displays the
# version number which I do not.
smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name</pre>
<p>Generally speaking any files that simply list one item per
line (like /etc/postfix/mydestination or
/etc/postfix/relaydomains) are usually just stored as a flat text
file. Files that contain mappings (i.e. aliases, where you have
entries like &#147;root: someuser&#148;) should be turned into
hashed database files for speed (you can specify the type of file
as hash, dbm, etc.).</p>
<p>Like most IBM products, Postfix has a very funky license, but
appears to be mostly open source and free. Postfix is available
at: <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
You can get binary postfix packages from a numer of sources
including most Linux vendors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Sendmail Pro">Sendmail Pro</a></h2>
<p>Sendmail Pro is a commercial version of Sendmail with support,
and is available at: <a href="http://www.sendmail.com/">http://www.sendmail.com/</a>.
I haven&#146;t been able to get a demo or find anyone using it so
I&#146;m not 100% sure as to how close it is to the
&#147;original&#148; Sendmail, although the company has told me
it uses the same code base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="QMAIL">QMAIL</a></h2>
<p>Qmail (like postfix) was created as a direct response to
perceived flaws in Sendmail. Qmail is not under an OpenSource
approved license, and there is no binary distribution clause
meaning you must install it from source code. OpenBSD has removed
Qmail from ports due to numerous conflicts with the license, and
I do not reccomend using Qmail as vendor support is non-existant.
Very little code in Qmail runs as root, and it is very modular
compared to Sendmail (which is a pretty monolithic piece of
code). You can download it from: <a href="http://www.qmail.org/">http://www.qmail.org/</a>.
An excellent book is available for free at: <a href="http://www.lifewithqmail.org/">http://www.lifewithqmail.org/</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="POP servers">POP servers</a></h2>
<p>POP (post Office Protocol) is a relatively simple protocol
that allows you to retrieve email from a server and delete it.
The basic commands are USER, PASS (used to login), LIST (to list
emails and sizes), RETR (to retrieve and email) and DELE (to
delete an email). </p>
<h2><a name="UW IMAPD (contains the default popd for most distros) POP"><strong>UW
IMAPD (contains the default popd for most distros)</strong></a></h2>
<p>POP and IMAP are fundamentally related but very different, so
I have split them apart. POP stands for &#147;Post Office
Protocol&#148; and simply allows you to list messages, retrieve
them, and delete them. There are many POP servers for Linux
available, the stock one that ships with most distributions is ok
for the majority of users. The main problems with POP are similar
to many other protocols; usernames and passwords are transmitted
in the clear, making it a very good target for packet sniffing.
POP can be SSL&#146;ified, however not all mail clients support
SSL secured POP. Most POP servers come configured to use
TCP_WRAPPERS, which is an excellent method for restricting
access. Please see the earlier section on TCP_WRAPPERS for more
information. POP runs as root (since it must access user
mailboxes) and there have been a number of nasty root hacks in
various POP servers in the past. POP runs on ports 109 and 110
(109 is basically obsolete though), using the tcp protocol. The
Washington University IMAPD server also comes with a pop server
and is generally the &#145;stock&#146; pop server that ships with
most Linux distributions. You can get it from: <a href="http://www.washington.edu/imap/">http://www.washington.edu/imap/</a>.</p>

<p>IMAP is a much more advanced mail protocol, allowing you to
retrieve email from the server, and manage it on the server (you
can create folders to store messages on the server). This
protocol is much more useful then POP since multiple email boxes
are a bit more graceful, multiple people using one email box is
workable, and for travelling users, since you download the
headers first (subject, etc) and can more selectively retrieve
email.</p>
<h2><a name="UW">UW</a><a name="WU IMAPD (contains the default imapd for most distros) IMAP">
IMAPD (contains the default imapd for most distros)</a></h2>
<p>IMAP is POP on steroids. It allows you to easily maintain
multiple accounts, have multiple people access one account, leave
mail on the server, just download the headers, or bodies and no
attachments, and so on. IMAP is ideal for anyone on the go or
with serious email needs. The default POP and IMAP servers that
most distributions ship (bundled together into a single package
named imapd oddly enough) fulfill most needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMAP also starts out as root, although imapd typically drops
to the privilege of the user accessing it, and cannot be easily
set to run as a non-root user since they have to open mailboxes
(and in IMAP&#146;s case create folders, files, etc. in the
user&#146;s home directory), so they cannot drop privileges as
soon as one would like. Nor can they easily be chroot'ed (IMAP
needs access to /var/spool/mail, and IMAP needs access to the
user&#146;s home directory). The best policy is to keep the
software up to date. And if at all possible, firewall pop and
imap from the outside world, this works well if no-one is on the
road and needs to collect their email via the Internet.
University Washington (UW) IMAPD is available from: <a href="http://www.washington.edu/imap/">http://www.washington.edu/imap/</a>.</p>
<p>IMAP runs on port 143 and most IMAPD servers support
TCP_WRAPPERS, making it relatively easy to lock down.&nbsp;</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 143
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 143

<h2><a name="Cyrus IMAP">Cyrus</a></h2>
<p>Cyrus is an imap (it also supports pop and kpop) server aimed
at &#145;closed&#146; environments. That is to say that the users
will not have any access to the mail server other then by imap or
pop protocols. This allows Cyrus to store the mail in a much more
secure manner and allows for easier management of larger
installations, and I highly recommend it. Cyrus is not GNU
licensed but is relatively &#147;free&#148;, and available from: <a href="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/imapd/">http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/imapd/</a>.
There is also a set of add on tools for Cyrus available from: <a href="ftp://ftp.hr.vc-graz.ac.at/cyrus-tools/">ftp://ftp.hr.vc-graz.ac.at/cyrus-tools/</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Scanning email for viruses">Scanning email for
viruses</a></h2>
<p>While Linux is not terribly suspectible to viruses, Windows
clients are.</p>
<h3>Protector</h3>
<p><a href="http://protector.sourceforge.net/">http://protector.sourceforge.net/</a>
blocks all attachments except those listed (i.e.a white list). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="AMaViS">AMaViS</a></h2>
<p>AMaViS uses third party scanning software (such as McAfee) to
scan incoming email for viruses. You can get AMaViS at: <a href="http://www.amavis.org/">http://www.amavis.org/</a>.
Make sure you get the latest version, previous ones have a root
compromise. </p>
<p><a name="Sendmail"><strong>Sendmail</strong></a></p>
<p>Using AMaViS with Sendmail is relatively simple, it has a
program called &#147;scanmail&#148; that acts as a replacement
for procmail (typically the program that handles local delivery
of email). When an email comes in instead of using procmail to
deliver it, Sendmail calls scanmail which decompresses and
decodes any attachments/etc. and then uses a virus scanner (of
your choice) to scan the attachments. If no virus is found mail
delivery goes ahead as usual. If a virus is found however, an
email is sent to the sender informing them that they have sent a
virus, and an email is sent to the intended recipient informing
them about the person that sent them a virus. The instructions
for this are at:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amavis.org/">http://www.amavis.org/</a></p>
<p><a name="Postfix"><strong>Postfix</strong></a></p>
<p>Since Postfix can make use of procmail to do local mail
delivery it should work in theory without any trouble. In
practice it takes a few minor tweaks to work correctly. To enable
it replace the line in main.cf:</p>
<pre>mailbox_command = /usr/bin/procmail</pre>
<p>with the line:</p>
<pre>mailbox_command = /usr/sbin/scanmails</pre>
<p>and restart postfix. For the local warning to work (a warning
is sent to the intended recipient of the message) the hostname of
the machine (sundog, mailserver01, etc.) must be listed in the
&#147;mydestination&#148; in main.cf, otherwise the warning does
not get delivered. You should (and most sites generally do)
redirect root&#146;s email to a user account using the aliases
file, otherwise warnings will not be delivered to root properly.
By default as well mail to &#147;virusalert&#148; is directed to
root, you should also redirect this mail to a normal user
account.</p>
