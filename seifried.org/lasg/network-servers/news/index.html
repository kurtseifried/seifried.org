<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>NNTP (network news transfer protocol) is useful for sharing
large amounts of information among many servers. It is also
useful for holding discussions and forums on topics like
cryptography.</p>
<h2><a name="NNTP server software">NNTP server software</a></h2>
<h2><a name="INN">INN</a></h2>
<p>The usenet server INN has had a long and varied history, for a
long period there were no official releases and it seemed to be
in a state of limbo. However, it is back for good now it would
seem. The server software is responsible for handling a
potentially enormous load, if you take a full newsfeed the server
must process several hundred articles per second, some several
kilobytes in size. It must index these articles, write them to
disk, and hand them out to clients that request them. INN itself
is relatively secure, since it handles data with a directory and
generally doesn't have access outside of that, however as with
any messaging system if you use it for private/confidential
material you must be careful. INN is currently maintained by ISC
and is available at: <a href="http://www.isc.org/products/INN/">http://www.isc.org/products/INN/</a>
</p>
<p>One of the main security threats with INN is resource
starvation on the server. If someone decides to flood your server
with bogus articles or there is a sudden surge of activity you
might be in trouble if capacity is lacking. INN has had several
bad security holes in past, but with today's environment the
programmers seem to have chased down and eliminated all of them
(none have surfaced recently). It is highly recommended (for more
than security reasons alone) that you place the news spool on a
separate disk system, let alone partition. You might also wish to
use ulimit to restrict the amount of memory available so that it
cannot bring the server to it's knees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for access, you should definitely not allow public access.
Any news server that is publicly accessible will be quickly
hammered by people using it to read news, send spam and the like.
Restrict reading of news to your clients/internal network and if
you are really worried force people to login. Client access to
INN is controlled via the nnrp.access file. You can specify IP
address(s), domain names and domains (such as *.example.org), as
well as there access levels (read and post), the newsgroups they
do or don't have access to and you can also specify a username
and password. However, because the password is linked to the
host/domain it gets somewhat messy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>example of nnrp.access:</p>
<pre>*:: -no - : -no- :!*
# denies access from all sites, for all actions (post and read), to all groups.
*.example.org::Read Post:::*
# hosts in example.org have full access to all groups
*.otherexample.org::Read:::*, !me.*
# hosts in otherexample.org have read access to everything but the me hierarchy
*.otherexample.org:Read Post:myname:mypassword:*
# give me access from my AOL account using a username and password</pre>
<p>If you are going to run a news server I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.ora.com/catalog/musenet/">O'Reilly book
&quot;Managing Usenet&quot;</a>. Usenet is similar to Sendmail, a
total beast to get running smoothly and keep happy.</p>
<p>News should be firewalled as most servers typically server an
internal group, and access connections from one or two upstream
feeds:</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 119
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 119
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 119</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 119
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s some.trusted.host -d 0.0.0.0/0 119
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 119</pre>
