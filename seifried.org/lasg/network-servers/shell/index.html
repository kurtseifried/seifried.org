<p>Getting access to your server remotely is critical for most
administrators. Most of us cannot sit down at the console and
login, and in any case remote access is much less effort in the
long run. Doing this securely is the trick of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Telnet">Telnet</a></h2>
<p>Telnet was one of the first services on what is now the
Internet, it allows you to login to a remote machine
interactively, issue commands and see their results. It is still
the primary default tools for remote administration in most
environments, and has nearly universal support (even NT has a
telnet daemon and client). It is also one of the most insecure
protocols, susceptible to sniffing, hijacking, etc. If you have
clients using telnet to come into the server you should
definitely chroot their accounts if possible, as well as
restricting telnet to the hosts they use with TCP_WRAPPERS. The
best solution for securing telnet is to disable it and use
SSL'ified telnet or ssh.</p>
<p>Problems with telnet include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear text authentication, username and password.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Clear text of all commands.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Password guessing attacks (minimal, will end up in the
log files)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The best solution is to turn telnet off and use ssh. This is
however not practical in all situations. If you must use telnet
then I strongly suggest firewalling it, have rules to allow
hosts/networks access to port 23, and then a general rule denying
access to port 23, as well as using TCP_WRAPPERS (which is more
efficient because the system only checks each telnet connection
and not every packet against the firewall rules) however using
TCP_WRAPPERS will allow people to establish the fact that you are
running telnet, it allows them to connect, evaluates the
connection, and then closes it if they are not listed as being
allowed in.&nbsp;<br>
An example of firewalling rules:</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 23
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 23
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 23</pre>
<p>or in ipchains:</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 23
ipchains -A input -p all -j ACCEPT -s some.trusted.host -d 0.0.0.0/0 23
ipchains -A input -p all -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 23</pre>
<p>An example of the same using TCP_WRAPPERS, in
/etc/hosts.allow:</p>
<pre>in.telnetd: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0, some.trusted.host</pre>
<p>And in /etc/hosts.deny:</p>
<pre>in.telnetd: ALL</pre>
<p>There are several encrypted alternatives to telnet as
mentioned before, ssh, SSLeay Telnet, and other third party
utils, I personally feel that the 'best' alternative if you are
going to go to the bother of ripping telnet out and replacing it
with something better is to use ssh.<br>
To secure user accounts with respect to telnet there are several
things you can do. Number one would be not letting root login via
telnet, this is controlled by /etc/securetty and by default in
most distributions root is restricted to logging on from the
console (a good thing). For a user to successfully login their
shell has to be valid (this is determined by the list of shells
in /etc/shells), so setting up user accounts that are allowed to
login is simply a matter of setting their shell to something
listed in /etc/shells, and keeping users out as simple as setting
their shell to /bin/false (or something else not listed in
/etc/shells. Now for some practical examples of what you can
accomplish by setting the user shell to things other then shells.</p>
<p>For an ISP that wishes to allow customers to change their
password easily, but not allow them access to the system (my ISP
uses Ultrasparcs and refuses to give out user accounts for some
reason, I wonder why).</p>
<p>in /etc/shells list:</p>
<pre>/usr/bin/passwd</pre>
<p>and set the users shell to /usr/bin/passwd so you end&nbsp;up
with something like:</p>
<pre>username:x:1000:1000::/home/username:/usr/bin/passwd</pre>
<p>and voila. The user telnets to the server, is prompted for
their username and password, and is&nbsp;<br>
then prompted to change their password. If they do so
successfully passwd then exits and they are disconnected. If they
are unsuccessful passwd exits and they are disconnected. The
following is a transcript of such a setup when a user telnets in:</p>
<pre>Trying 1.2.3.4&#133;
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

Red Hat Linux release 5.2 (Apollo)
Kernel 2.2.5 on an i586
login: tester
Password:&nbsp;
Changing password for tester
(current) UNIX password:&nbsp;
New UNIX password:&nbsp;
Retype new UNIX password:&nbsp;
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully
Connection closed by foreign host.</pre>
<p>Telnet also displays a banner by default when someone
connects. This banner typically contains systems information like
the name, OS, release and sometimes other detailed information
such as the kernel version. Historically this was useful if you
had to work on multiple OS's, however in today's hostile Internet
it is generally more harmful then useful. Telnetd displays the
contents of the file /etc/issue.net (typically it is identical to
/etc/issue which is displayed on terminals and so forth), this
file is usually recreated at boot time in most Linux
distributions, from the rc.local startup file. Simply edit the
rc.local file, either modifying what it puts into /etc/issue and
/etc/issue.net, or comment out the lines that create those files,
then edit the files with some static information.</p>
<p>Typical Linux rc.local contents pertaining to /etc/issue and
/etc/issue.net:</p>
<pre># This will overwrite /etc/issue at every boot. So, make any changes you
# want to make to /etc/issue here or you will lose them when you reboot.
echo &quot;&quot; &gt; /etc/issue
echo &quot;$R&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/issue
echo &quot;Kernel $(uname -r) on $a $(uname -m)&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/issue
cp -f /etc/issue /etc/issue.net
echo &gt;&gt; /etc/issue</pre>
<p>simply comment out the lines or remove the uname commands. If
you absolutely must have telnet enabled for user logins make sure
you have a disclaimer printed:</p>
<pre>This system is for authorized users only. Trespassers will be prosecuted.</pre>
<p>or something like the above. Legally you are in a stronger
position if someone cracks into the system or otherwise abuses
your telnet daemon.</p>
<h2><a name="Telnet - SSL">Telnet - SSL</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="SSLtelnet and MZtelnet">SSLtelnet and MZtelnet</a></h2>
<p>A drop in replacement for telnet, SSLtelnet and MZtelnet
provide a much higher level of security then plain old telnet,
although SSLtelnet and MZtelnet are not as flexible as SSH, they
are perfectly free (i.e., GNU licensed) which SSH is not
(although OpenSSH is *BSD licensed). The server and client
packages are available as tarballs at: <a href="ftp://ftp.uni-mainz.de/pub/internet/security/ssl/">ftp://ftp.uni-mainz.de/pub/internet/security/ssl/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="SSH - server and client software">SSH - server and
client software</a></h2>
<p>SSH is a secure protocol and set of tools to replace some
common (insecure) ones. It was designed from the beginning to
offer a maximum of security and allows remote access to servers
in a secure manner. SSH can be used to secure any network based
traffic, by setting it up as a 'pipe' (i.e. binding it to a
certain port at both ends). This is quite kludgy but good for
such things as using X across the Internet. In addition to this
the server components runs on most UNIX systems, and NT, and the
client components runs on pretty much anything. Unfortunately SSH
is no longer free; however, there is a project to create a free
implementation of the SSH protocol. There aren't any problems
with SSH per se like there are with telnet, all session traffic
is encrypted and the key exchange is done relatively securely
(alternatively you can preload keys at either end to prevent them
from being transmitted and becoming vulnerable to man in the
middle attacks).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>OpenSSH</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use openssh, available from <a href="http://www.ssh.com/">http://www.ssh.com/</a>.
OpenSSH ships with almost all Linux distributions and typically
installs by default. SSH typically runs as a daemon, and can
easily be locked down by using the sshd_config file. </p>
<p>The firewalling rules for ssh are pretty much identical to
telnet. There is of course TCP_WRAPPERS, the problem with
TCP_WRAPPERS being that an attacker connects to the port, but
doesn't get a daemon, HOWEVER they know that there is something
on that port, whereas with firewalling they don't even get a
connection to the port. The following is an example of allowing
people to ssh from internal machines, and a certain C class on
the internet (say the C class your ISP uses for it's dial-up pool
of modems).&nbsp;</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 22
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S isp.dial.up.pool/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0 22
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 22</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 22
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s isp.dial.up.pool/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0 22
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 22</pre>
<p>Or via TCP_WRAPPERS, hosts.allow:</p>
<pre>sshd: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0, isp.dial.up.pool/255.255.255.0</pre>
<p>hosts.deny:</p>
<pre>sshd: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0</pre>
<p>In addition to this, ssh has a wonderful configuration file,
/etc/sshd/sshd_config by default in most installations. You can
easily restrict who is allowed to login, which hosts, and what
type of authentication they are allowed to use. The default
configuration file is relatively safe but following is a more
secure one with explanations. Please note all this info can be
obtained by a &#147;man sshd&#148; which is one of the few well
written man pages out there. The following is a typical
sshd_config file:</p>
<pre>Port 22
# runs on port 22, the standard
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
# listens to all interfaces, you might only want to bind a firewall
# internally, etc
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
# where the host key is
RandomSeed /etc/ssh/ssh_random_seed
# where the random seed is
ServerKeyBits 768
# how long the server key is
LoginGraceTime 300
# how long they get to punch their credentials in
KeyRegenerationInterval 3600
# how often the server key gets regenerated&nbsp;
PermitRootLogin no
# permit root to login? no
IgnoreRhosts yes
# ignore .rhosts files in users dir? yes
StrictModes yes
# ensures users don't do silly things
QuietMode no
# if yes it doesn't log anything. yikes. we want to log logins/etc.
X11Forwarding no
# forward X11? shouldn't have to on a server
FascistLogging no
# maybe we don't want to log too much.
PrintMotd yes
# print the message of the day? always nice
KeepAlive yes
# ensures sessions will be properly disconnected
SyslogFacility DAEMON
# who's doing the logging?
RhostsAuthentication no
# allow rhosts to be used for authentication? the default is no
# but nice to say it anyways
RhostsRSAAuthentication no
# is authentication using rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv sufficient
# not in my mind. the default is yes so lets turn it off.&nbsp;
RSAAuthentication yes
# allow pure RSA authentication? this one is pretty safe
PasswordAuthentication yes
# allow users to use their normal login/passwd? why not.
PermitEmptyPasswords no
# permit accounts with empty password to log in? no</pre>
<p>Other useful sshd_config directives in 1.2.x include:</p>
<pre>AllowGroups - explicitly allow groups (/etc/group) to login using ssh
DenyGroups - explicitly disallows groups (/etc/groups) from logging in
AllowUsers - explicitly allow users to login in using ssh
DenyUsers - explicitly blocks users from logging in
IdleTimeout time - time in minutes/hours/days/etc, forces a logout by SIGHUP'ing the process.</pre>
<p>These directives appear to have been removed from current
OpenSSH versions:</p>
<p>AllowHosts - allow certain hosts, the rest will be denied<br>
DenyHosts - blocks certain hosts, the rest will be allowed</p>
<p>Make sure your sshd is compiled with tcp_wrappers support and
use hosts.allow and hosts.deny instead. </p>

<h2><a name="SRP">SRP</a></h2>
<p>SRP is a relative newcomer, however it has several advantages
over some of the older programs. SRP is free and does not use
encryption per se to secure the data, so exporting it outside of
the US isn&#146;t as much of a problem (there is a version that
encrypts and is available within the US and Canada, and
interoperates with the non encrypting version of SRP). SRP is
available from <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/">http://srp.stanford.edu/</a>.
SRP currently has Telnet and FTP support (for windows as well)
although SRP enabling other protocols is relatively
straightforward. A windows client with SRP capabilities is

<h2><a name="NSH">NSH</a></h2>
<p>NSH is a commercial product with all the bells and whistles
(and I do mean all). It&#146;s got built in support for
encryption, so it&#146;s relatively safe to use (I cannot verify
this completely however, as it isn&#146;t open source). Ease of
use is high, you cd //computername and that &#145;logs&#146; you
into that computer, you can then easily copy/modify/etc. files,
run ps and get the process listing for that computer, etc. NSH
also has a Perl module available, making scripting of commands
pretty simple, and is ideal for administering many like systems
(such as workstations). In addition to this NSH is available on
multiple platforms (Linux, BSD, Irix, etc.) with RPM&#146;s
available for Red Hat systems. NSH is available from: <a href="http://www.networkshell.com/">http://www.networkshell.com/</a>,
and 30 day evaluation versions are easily downloaded.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="R services">R services</a></h2>
<p>R services such as rsh, rcp, rexec and so forth are very
insecure. There is simply no other way to state it, DO NOT USE
THEM. Their security is based on the hostname/IP address of the
machine connecting, which can easily be spoofed or, using
techniques such as DNS poisoning, otherwise compromised. By
default they are not all disabled, please do so immediately. Edit
/etc/inetd.conf and look for rexec, rsh and so on, and comment
them out, followed by a &quot;killall -1 inetd&quot; to restart
inetd.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must run these services use TCP_WRAPPERS to
restrict access, it's not much but it will help. Also make sure
you firewall them as TCP_WRAPPERS will allow an attacker to see
that they are running, which might result in a spoofed attack,
something TCP_WRAPPERS cannot defend against if done properly.
Access to the various R services is controlled via rhosts files,
usually each user has their own rhosts file, unfortunately this
is susceptible to packet spoofing. The problem with r services is
also that once there is a minor security breach that can be used
to modify files, editing a users (like root's) .rhost file makes
it very easy to crack a system wide open.</p>
<p>If you need remote administration tools that are easy to use
and similar to rsh/etc I would recommend NSH (Network SHell) or
SSH, they both support encryption, and a much higher level of
security. Alternatively using VPN software will reduce some of
the risk as you can deny packet spoofers the chance to compromise
your system(s) (part of IPSec is authentication of sender and
source, which is almost more important then encrypting the data
in some cases).</p>
