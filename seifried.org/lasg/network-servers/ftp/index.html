<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>FTP used to be the most used protocol on the Internet by sheer
data traffic until it was surpassed by HTTP a few years ago (yes,
there was a WWW-free Internet once upon a time). FTP does one
thing, and it does it well, transferring of files between
systems. The protocol itself is insecure, passwords, data, etc is
transferred in cleartext and can easily be sniffed, however most
ftp usage is 'anonymous', so this isn't a huge problem. One of
the main problems typically encountered with ftp sites is
improper permissions on directories that allow people to use the
site to distribute their own data (typically copyrighted
material, etc). Again as with telnet you should use an account
for ftping that is not used for administrative work since the
password will be flying around the network in clear text.</p>
<p>Problems with ftp in general include:</p>
<p> Clear text authentication, username and password.&nbsp;<br>
 Clear text of all commands.&nbsp;<br>
 Password guessing attacks<br>
 Improper server setup and consequent abuse of servers&nbsp;<br>
 Several nasty Denial of Service attacks still exist in various
ftp servers<br>
 Older version of WU-FTPD and derivatives have root hacks&nbsp;</p>
<p>Securing FTP isn't to bad, between firewalling and
TCP_WRAPPERS you can restrict access based on IP address /
hostname quite well. In addition most ftp servers run chroot'ed
by default for anyone anonymous access, or an account defined as
guest. With some amount of work you can set all users that are
ftping in to be chroot'ed to their home directory or wherever
appropriate. You can also run ftp servers that encrypts the data
(using such things as SSL/etc.) however this means your ftp
clients must speak the encryption protocol, and this isn't always
practical. Also make very sure you have no publicly accessible
directories on your ftp server that are both readable and
writeable, otherwise people will exploit it to distribute their
own software (typically warez or porn).</p>
<p>An example of firewalling rules:</p>
<pre>ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S 10.0.0.0/8 -D 0.0.0.0/0 21
ipfwadm -I -a accept -P tcp -S some.trusted.host -D 0.0.0.0/0 21
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 0.0.0.0/0 21</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 0.0.0.0/0 21
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s some.trusted.host -d 0.0.0.0/0 21
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 21</pre>
<p>An example of the same using TCP_WRAPPERS in /etc/hosts.allow:</p>
<pre>in.ftpd: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0, some.trusted.host</pre>
<p>And in /etc/hosts.deny:</p>
<pre>in.ftpd: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0</pre>
<p>There are several encrypted alternatives to ftp as mentioned
before, SSLeay FTPD, and other third party utils. Since most ftp
accounts are not used as admin accounts (cleartext passwords, you
have been warned), and hopefully run chroot'ed, the security risk
is minimized. Now that we have hopefully covered all the network
based parts of ftp, lets go over securing the user accounts and
environment.</p>
<h2><a name="FTP servers">FTP servers</a></h2>
<p>There are numerous ftp server software packages available for
Linux. The popular ones (Wu-FTPD and ProFTPD) have had a severe
number of problems, so make sure your version is up to date.</p>
<h2>vsftpd</h2>
<p><br>
Ok, the thing deserves a 1.x release version now, it seems to be
doing<br>
useful work on various production sites.<br>
<br>
Before the 1.0 release details, something potentially
interesting: my next<br>
project. Before I start investigating the feasability, I want to
judge the<br>
demand. I'm considering a &quot;vssshd&quot;, which would be a
very cut down/minimal<br>
server-only implementation of the ssh2 protocol. The intended
audience<br>
would be paranoid people who want no-frills secure remote access.
I'm not<br>
saying the current sshd implementations are insecure; however,
their<br>
design leaves something to be desired. In particular there seems
to be<br>
rather too much use of &quot;root&quot; (witness the severity of
the deattack.c<br>
flaw). I am tempted to investigate the possibility of writing a
minimal<br>
sshd where all protocol parsing and in particular SSL code runs
as<br>
non-root in a chroot() environment.<br>

<br>
Approximate changelog:<br>
- Fix build on RedHat7.2<br>
- Fix build on Mandrake systems<br>
<br>
README:<br>
vsftpd is an FTP server, or daemon. The &quot;vs&quot; stands for
Very Secure.<br>
Obviously this is not a guarantee, but a reflection that I have
written<br>
the entire codebase with security in mind, and carefully designed
the<br>
program to be resilient to attack.<br>
<br>
Recent evidence shows that vsftpd is also extremely fast and
scalable. vsftpd<br>
has achieved ~4000 concurrent users on a single machine, in a
production<br>
environment.<br>
<br>
vsftpd is now a proven stable solution. Of particular note,
RedHat used vsftpd<br>
to enable <a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com">ftp.redhat.com</a> to
support 15,000 concurrent users across their<br>
server pool. This extreme load was generated by the release of
RedHat 7.2<br>
to the world.<br>

<h2><a name="ProFTPD">ProFTPD</a></h2>
<p>ProFTPD is a GPL licensed ftp server that can run on a variety
on UNIX platforms. It supports newer features such as virtual
ftp, per directory configuration (using .ftpaccess files similar
to Apache&#146;s .htaccess files), support for expired accounts
and more. It also supports really useful features such as
limiting downloads and much tighter security controls then
WU-FTPD. I highly recommend it over any other freely available
FTP server for UNIX.</p>
<p>ProFTPD&#146;s main configuration file is /etc/proftpd.conf,
it has a rather Apache-esque configuration style which I like a
lot. ProFTPD can be run from inetd (and make use of TCP_WRAPPERS)
or it can be run as a stand-alone server. It also supports per
directory config files to limit access and so forth. ProFTPD
supports virtual ftp as well (although unlike virtual www
serving, extra IP addresses are required) and each site can be
configured differently (different anonymous access, if any, and
more things along those lines). The general proftpd.conf
typically has a section covering global settings (inetd or
standalone, maximum number of processes to run, who to run as,
and so on), followed by a default config, followed by specific
site (virtual sites) configuration. On a server doing virtual
hosting it is probably a good idea to turn
&#147;DefaultServer&#148; off, so any clients ftping in aimlessly
are denied instead of being dumped into a default site.</p>
<p>Sample configuration for a ProFTPD server being run from inetd
with no anonymous access:</p>
<pre>ServerName &quot;ProFTPD Default Installation&quot;
ServerType inetd
DefaultServer on
Port 21
Umask 022
MaxInstances 30
User nobody
Group nobody
&lt;Directory /*&gt;
AllowOverwrite on
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
<p>Let&#146;s say, like me, that you are paranoid and want to
control access to the ftp server by IP addresses, hostnames and
domain names (although I would recommend only relying on
IP&#146;s). You could accomplish via firewall rules, but that
tends to slow the machine down (especially if you are adding lots
of rules as would be prone to happen). You could use
TCP_WRAPPERS, but you wouldn&#146;t be able to selectively limit
access to virtual sites, anonymous sites, just the server itself.
Or you could do it in the proftpd.conf file using the
&#147;&lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;&#148; directive.</p>
<p>The following example will limit access to 10.1.*.* and
1.2.3.4, all other machines will be denied access.</p>
<pre>&lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;
Order Allow,Deny
Allow from 10.1., 1.2.3.4
Deny from all
&lt;/Limit&gt;</pre>
<p>If you place this within a &#147;&lt;VirtualHost&gt;&#148; or
&#147;&lt;Anonymous&gt;&#148; directives it applies only to that
virtual site or anonymous setup, if placed in a
&#147;&lt;Global&gt;&#148; directive it will apply to all the
&#147;&lt;VirtualHost&gt;&#148; and &#147;&lt;Anonymous&gt;&#148;
sections, and if placed in the server config (i.e. with the
&#147;ServerName&#148; and related items) it will behave like
TCP_WRAPPERS would, anyone not from 10.1.*.* or 1.2.3.4
immediately gets bumped when they try to connect to port 21, as
opposed to simply being denied login if it&#146;s in a
&#147;&lt;Global&gt;&#148;, &#147;&lt;VirtualHost&gt;&#148; or
&#147;&lt;Anonymous&gt;&#148; section.</p>
<p>If you want to add anonymous access simply append:</p>
<pre>&lt;Anonymous ~ftp&gt;
User ftp
Group ftp
RequireValidShell off
UserAlias anonymous ftp
MaxClients 10
DisplayLogin welcome.msg
DisplayFirstChdir .message
&lt;Directory *&gt;
&lt;Limit WRITE&gt;
DenyAll
&lt;/Limit&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/Anonymous&gt;</pre>
<p>This would assign the &#147;ftp&#148; users home directory
(assuming a normal setup &#147;~ftp&#148; would probably be
/home/ftp) as the root anonymous directory, the ProFTPD would run
as the user &#147;ftp&#148; and group &#147;ftp&#148; when people
log in anonymously (as opposed to logging in as a normal user),
and anonymous logins would be limited to 10. As well the file
/home/ftp/welcome.msg would be displayed when anonymous users ftp
in, and any directory with a .message file containing text would
be displayed when they changed into it. The &#147;&lt;Directory
*&gt;&#148; covers /home/ftp/*, and then denies write access for
all, meaning no-one can upload any files. If you wanted to add an
incoming directory simply add the following after the
&#147;&lt;Directory *&gt;&#148; directives:</p>
<pre>&lt;Directory incoming&gt;
&lt;Limit WRITE&gt;
AllowAll
&lt;/Limit&gt;
&lt;Limit READ&gt;
DenyAll
&lt;/Limit&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
<p>This would allow people to write files to /home/ftp/incoming/,
but not read (i.e. download) them. As you can see ProFTPD is very
flexible, this results in ProFTPD requiring more horsepower then
WU-FTPD, but it is definitely worth it for the added control. You
can get ProFTPD and the documentation from: <a href="http://www.proftpd.net/">http://www.protftpd.net/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>proftpd-ldap</strong></p>
<p>proftpd-ldap allows you to do password look ups using an LDAP
directory, you can download it from: <a href="http://horde.net/~jwm/software/proftpd-ldap/">http://horde.net/~jwm/software/proftpd-ldap/</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="WU-FTPD">WU-FTPD</a></h2>
<p>WuFTPD used to have numerous security issues however 2 years
ago a security audit was done by SuSE and many of the problems
were removed. If you use WuFTPD make sure it is a descendant of
the audited version (it should be unless the vendor is using an
ancient codebase). </p>
<p>One of the main security mechanisms in WU-FTPD is the use of
chroot. For example; by default all people logging in as
anonymous have /home/ftp/ set as their &#147;root&#148;
directory. They cannot get out of this and say look at the
contents of /home/ or /etc/. The same can be applied to groups of
users and / or individuals, for example you could set all users
to be chroot'ed to /home/ when they ftp in, or in extreme cases
of user privacy (say on a www server hosting multiple domains)
set each user chroot'ed to within their own home directory. This
is accomplished through the use of /etc/ftpaccess and /etc/passwd
(man ftpaccess has all the info). I will give a few examples of
what needs to be done to accomplish this since it can be quite
confusing at first. ftpd also checks /etc/ftpusers and if the
user attempting to login is listed in that file (like root should
be) it will not let the user login via ftp.</p>
<p>To chroot users as they login into the ftp server is rather
simple, but poorly documented. The ftp server check
/etc/ftpaccess for &#147;guestgroup&#148;&#146;s, which are
simply &quot;guestgroup some-group-on-the-system&quot; i.e.
&quot;guestgroup users&quot;. The groupname needs to be defined
in /etc/group and have members added. You need to edit their
passwd file line so that the ftp server knows where to dump them.
And since they are now chroot'ed into that directory on the
system, they do not have access to /lib, etc so you must copy
certain files into their dir for things like &#147;ls&#148; to
work properly (always a nice touch).</p>
<p>Setting up a user (billybob) so that he can ftp in, and ends
up chroot'ed in his home directory (because he keeps threatening
to take the sysadmin possum hunting). In addition to this
billybob can telnet in and change his password, but nothing else
because he keeps trying to run ircbots on the system. The system
he is on uses shadowed passwords, so that's why there is an 'x'
in billybob's password field.</p>
<p>First off billybob needs a properly setup user account in
/etc/passwd:</p>
<pre>billybob:x:500:500:Billy Bob:/home/billybob/./:/usr/bin/passwd</pre>
<p>this means that the ftp server will chroot billybob into
/home/billybob/ and chdir him into what is now / (/home/billybob
to the rest of us). The ftpaccess man file covers this bit ok,
and of course /usr/sbin/passwd needs to be listed in /etc/shells.</p>
<p>Secondly, for the ftp server to know that he is being
chroot'ed he needs to be a member of a group (badusers,
ftppeople, etc) that is defined in /etc/group. And then that
group must be listed in /etc/ftpaccess.</p>
<p>Now you need to copy some libraries and binaries in the chroot
&#147;jail&#148;, otherwise &#147;billybob&#148; won't be able to
do a whole lot once he has ftp'ed in. The files needed are
available as packages (usually called &#147;anonftp&#148;), once
this is installed the files will be copied to /home/ftp/, you
will notice there is an /etc/passwd, this is simply uses to map
UID's to usernames, if you want billybob to see his username and
not UID, add a line for him (i.e., copy his line from the real
/etc/passwd to this one). The same applies to the group file as
well.</p>
<p>without &quot;billybob:*:500:500:::&quot; in
/home/billybob/etc/passwd:</p>
<pre>drwxr-xr-x 2 500 500 1024 Jul 14 20:46 billybob</pre>
<p>and with the line added to /home/billybob/etc/passwd:</p>
<pre>drwxr-xr-x 2 billybob 500 1024 Jul 14 20:46 billybob</pre>
<p>and with a line for billybob's group added to
/home/billybob/etc/group:</p>
<pre>drwxr-xr-x 2 billybob billybob 1024 Jul 14 20:46 billybob</pre>
<p>Billybob can now ftp into the system, upload and download
files from /home/billybob to his hearts content, change his
password all on his own, and do no damage to the system, nor
download the passwords file or other nasty things.</p>
<p>FTP is also a rather special protocol in that the clients
connect to port 21 (typically) on the ftp server, and then port
20 of the ftp server connects to the client and that is the
connection that the actual data is sent over. This means that
port 20 has to make outgoing connections. Keep this in mind when
setting up a firewall either to protect ftp servers or clients
using ftp. As well there is 'passive' ftp and usually used by www
browsers/etc, which involves incoming connections to the ftp
server on high port numbers (instead of using 20 they agree on
something else). If you intend to have a public ftp server put up
a machine that JUST does the ftp serving, and nothing else,
preferably outside of your internal LAN (see Practical Unix and
Internet Security for discussions of this 'DMZ' concept). You can
get WU-FTPD from <a href="http://www.wu-ftpd.org/">http://www.wu-ftpd.org/</a>
