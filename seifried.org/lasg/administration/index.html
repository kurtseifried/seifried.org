<p>There are a variety of tools to make administration of systems
easier, from local tools like sudo which grant limited superuser
privileges to www based systems that allow for remote management
from a cybercafe while on vacation. For information on how to
login remotely (i.e. interactive shell prompts) please see the <a href="../network-servers/shell/index.html">shell server</a>
section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Local tools</h2>
<p>While it is possible to administer a Linux system from the
command line using no &quot;additional&quot; tools it can be
bothersome. If you wish to split up administrative tasks the
&quot;sub administrators&quot; will often require root access to
restart daemons, modify configuration files and so forth. Simply
giving them all root access, or sharing the root password is
often the first step to serious problem (this is one of the major
reasons many large sites get broken into). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>YaST</h3>
<p>YaST (Yet Another Setup Tool) is a rather nice command line
graphical interface (very similar to scoadmin) that provides an
easy interface to most administrative tasks. It does not however
have any provisions for giving users limited access, so it is
really only useful for cutting down on errors, and allowing new
users to administer their systems. Another problem is unlike
Linuxconf it is not network aware, meaning you must log into each
system you want to manipulate.&nbsp;YaST version two is now
available and includes many new features as well as bug fixes, it
is recommended you upgrade. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>sudo</h3>
<p>Sudo gives a user setuid access to a program(s), and you can
specify which host(s) they are allowed to login from (or not) and
have sudo access (thus if someone breaks into an account, but you
have it locked down damage is minimized). You can specify what
user a command will run as, giving you a relatively fine degree
of control. If you must grant users access, be sure to specify
the hosts they are allowed to log in from when using sudo, as
well give the full pathnames to binaries, it can save you
significant grief in the long run (i.e. if I give a user sudo
access to &quot;adduser&quot;, there is nothing to stop them
editing their path statement, and copying bash to /tmp/adduser
and grabbing control of the box.). This tool is very similar to
super but with slightly less fine grained control. Sudo is
available for most distributions as a core package or a
contributed package. Sudo is available from <a href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/">http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/</a>
(just in case your distribution does not ship with it). Sudo
allows you to define groups of hosts, groups of commands, and
groups of users, making long term administration simpler. Several
/etc/sudoers examples:</p>
<pre>#Give the user &#145;seifried&#146; full access
seifried ALL=(ALL) ALL</pre>
<pre>#Create a group of users, a group of hosts, and allow then to shutdown the server as root
Host_Alias WORKSTATIONS=localhost, station1, station2
User_Alias SHUTDOWNUSERS=bob, mary, jane
Cmnd_Alias REBOOT=halt, reboot, sync
Runas_Alias REBOOTUSER=admin
SHUTDOWNUSERS WORKSTATIONS=(REBOOTUSER) REBOOT</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Super</h3>
<p>Super is one of the very few tools that can actually be used
to give certain users (and groups) varied levels of access to
system administration. In addition to this you can specify times
and allow access to scripts, giving setuid access to even
ordinary commands could have unexpected consequences (any editor,
any file manipulation tools like chown, chmod, even tools like lp
could compromise parts of the system). Debian ships with super,
and there are rpm's available in the contrib directory. This is a
very powerful tool (it puts sudo to shame in some ways), but
requires a significant amount of effort to implement properly
(like any powerful tool), and I think it is worth the effort.
Some example config files are usually in the /usr/doc/super-xxxx/
directory. Super is avialable <a href="ftp://ftp.ucolick.org/pub/users/will/">ftp://ftp.ucolick.org/pub/users/will/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WWW based tools</h2>
<p>WWW based administration tools provide an attractive solution
since virtually every modern computer and Internet access point
is web capable (sometimes that is all they are capable of). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Webmin</h3>
<p>Webmin has had number of security problems so make sure you
are using the most recent one. Webmin is one of the better remote
administration tools for Linux, written primarily in Perl it is
easy to use and easy to setup. You can assign different 'users'
(usernames and passwords are held internally by Webmin) varying
levels of access, for example you could assign bob access to
shutdown the server only, and give john access to create/delete
and manipulate users only. In addition to this it works on most
Linux platforms and a variety of other UNIX platforms. The main
'problem' with Webmin is somewhat poor documentation in some
areas of usage, and the fact that the username/password pair are
sent in clear text over the network (this is minimized slightly
by the ability to grant access to only certain hosts(s) and
networks). Most importantly it makes the system more accessible
to non-technical people who must administer systems in such a way
that you do not have to grant them actual accounts on the server.
Webmin is available <a href="http://www.webmin.com/webmin/">http://www.webmin.com/webmin/</a>,
and is currently free. Webmin defaults to running on port 10000
and should be firewalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Linuxconf</h3>
<p>Linuxconf is a general purpose Linux administration tool that
is usable from the command line, from within X, or via it's built
in www server. From within X it provides an overall view of
everything that can be configured (PPP, users, disks, etc.). To
use it via a www browser you must first run Linuxconf on the
machine and add the host(s) or network(s) you want to allow to
connect (Conf &gt; Misc &gt; Linuxconf network access), save
changes and quit. Then when you connect to the machine (by
default Linuxconf runs on port 98) you must enter a username and
password. By default Linuxconf only accepts root as the account,
and Linuxconf doesn't support any encryption (it runs standalone
on port 901), so I would have to recommend very strongly against
using this feature across networks unless you have IPSec or some
other form of IP level security. Linuxconf ships with several
distributions and is available <a href="http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/linuxconf/">http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/linuxconf/</a>.
Linuxconf also doesn't seem to ship with any man pages/etc, the
help is contained internally which is slightly irritating. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Other network based tools</h2>
<p>On the other hand web based administration tools tend to be
limited, and are typically not designed for hetrogenous
installations (i.e. Linux, HP-UX, AIX and so forth).
&quot;Industrial&quot; strength tools may be called for, like the
following ones. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pikt</h3>
<p>Pikt is an extremely interesting tool, it is actually more of
a scripting language aimed at system administration then a simple
program. Pikt allows you to do things such as killing off idle
user processes, enforcing mail quotas, monitor the system for
suspicious usage patterns (off hours, etc), and much more. About
the only problem with Pikt will be a steep learning tools, as it
uses it&#146;s own scripting language, but ultimately I think
mastering this language will pay off if you have many systems to
administer (especially since Pikt runs on Solaris, Linux and
FreeBSD currently). Pikt is available at: <a href="http://pikt.uchicago.edu/pikt/">http://pikt.uchicago.edu/pikt/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VNC</h3>
<p>Virtual Network Computer (VNC) is similar to X or PCAnywhere.
You can display a graphical desktop, and control it remotely,
with NT or Linux as the server and/or client. VNC across 10
megabit Ethernet is quite good, however it does tend to use a lot
of computer power relative to other methods of remote
administration. You can get VNC <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/</a>.
Security VNC isn't so great, but there are several sites with
information on securing VNC, using SSL, SSH and other methods.
There is also a page on securing VNC with SSH port forwarding at:
<a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/answers/vnc-thru-firewall-via-ssh.txt">http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/answers/vnc-thru-firewall-via-ssh.txt</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>cfengine</h3>
<p>cfengine is a set of tools for automating administration tasks
and is network aware. You can get cfengine <a href="http://www.cfengine.org/">http://www.cfengine.org/</a>.</p>
