<p>IP Security (IPSec) is the encryption of network traffic. You
cannot encrypt the header information or trailer (i.e. the IP
address/port the packet is from, and going to, the CRC checksums,
and so on), but you can encrypt the data payload. This allows you
to secure protocols such as POP/WWW without having to change them
in any ways, since the encryption occurs at the IP level. It also
allows you to securely connects LANs and clients to each other
over insecure networks (like the Internet). Currently IPSec for
Linux is in testing, however there have been several stable
releases, and I myself have deployed Linux based IPSec servers
successfully. IPSec is a standard, and a part of the IPv6
protocol, you can already purchase IPSec software for Windows
95/98/NT, Solaris, and other unices that will interoperate with
Linux IPSec. For &quot;drilling&quot; through a firewall or
perhaps to get by a NAT box (such as Linux with IP Masquerading)
please see the <a href="../firewall/index.html">firewall section</a>.</p>
<p>FreeSWAN is a free, OpenSource IPSec implementation for Linux.
It's a pretty solid implementation however not as advanced as
some, automatic keying and certificate support is well under way
though, and should be &quot;production&quot; quality relatively
soon.</p>

<p>You will need to compile support into your kernel, this is a
somewhat tricky process, but if you follow the instructions
included it should go smoothly. The primary difficulty is usually
setting up the configuration file, you will definitely want to
read the IPSec documentation for this as it changes (especially
when support for new features is added).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freeswan.org/download.html">http://www.freeswan.org/download.html</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="IPSec kernel support">IPSec kernel support</a></h2>
<p>To use IPSec you need IPSec support in the kernel.
Unfortunately no American Linux distribution can ship strong
crypto outside of North America so generally speaking they choose
not to include it at all, of the foreign Linux distributions,
currently, none ship with IPSec support built into the kernel.
You will need to get the kernel source (I recommend 2.2.13, as of
December 1999), and the Linux IPSec source code, available from: <a href="http://www.freeswan.org/">http://www.freeswan.org/</a>
(current stable snapshot 1.2, as of December 1999).</p>
<p>Install the kernel source (usually to /usr/src/linux) and then
compile a new kernel, install it, boot to it, and test it. Make
sure your networks work properly, if they don&#146;t work,
getting IPSec to work will be impossible. Now you need to
download the latest IPSec software (version 1.0 will NOT work
with 2.2.x kernels). Then go to /usr/local/src (or wherever you
put your source code for programs), unpack the source and run the
install program (make menugo typically for the ncurses based
configuration). This will patch the kernel files, then run the
kernel configuration, and then build the IPSec tools, and the
kernel.</p>
<pre>cd /usr/local/src/
tar &#150;zvvxf /path/to/tarball/snapshot.tar.gz
chown &#150;R root:root freeswan-snap1999Jun14b
cd freeswan-snap1999Jun14b
make menugo&nbsp;</pre>
<p>make sure you save the kernel configuration, even though the
options are chosen they have not been saved. You might also have
to rebuild the kernel as the &quot;make menugo&quot; command
sometimes runs a &quot;make zImage&quot; which usually fails due
to the large kernel sizes with 2.2.x. Once the compile is done it
should have an error message or two, simply:</p>
<pre>cd /usr/src/linux
make bzImage
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.13-ipsec&nbsp;</pre>
<p>Now we need to edit lilo.conf, rerun lilo, and reboot to make
use of the new kernel. lilo.conf should look like:</p>
<pre>boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=100
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.13-ipsec
label=linux-ipsec
root=/dev/hda1
read-only
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.13
label=linux
root=/dev/hda1
read-only&nbsp;</pre>
<p>rerun lilo and you should see:</p>
<pre>linux-ipsec *
linux&nbsp;</pre>
<p>then reboot and you should be running kernel 2.2.13 with IPSec
support. As the machine reboots and starts the IPSec stuff you
will see several errors, by default IPSec is set to use the
eth999 interface, which of course does not exist. You should also
add /usr/local/lib/ipsec to your path statement or else you will
have to type the full path in a lot.</p>
<h2><a name="IPSec network setup">IPSec network setup</a></h2>
<p>You will need to enable TCP-IP forwarding on the gateway
server, in Red Hat Linux this is accomplished by changing the
line in /etc/sysconfig/network from:</p>
<pre>FORWARD_IPV4=&quot;false&#148;</pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre>FORWARD_IPV4=&quot;yes&quot;</pre>
<p>or you can enable it via the /proc filesystem:</p>
<pre>cat 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</pre>
<p>Since most people have default deny policies for forwarding
packets you will need to allow packets to traverse from the
remote network / machine to your network / machine and vice
versa. In addition to this, any masquerading rules for internal
networks that are also using IPSec must come after the rules
allowing IPSec related traffic, or the machine will try to
masquerade the packets, instead of them being passed over to
IPSec.</p>
<h2><a name="IPSec configuration">IPSec configuration</a></h2>
<p>Then you need to configure your ipsec settings. These are
typically held in /etc/ipsec.conf, and /etc/ipsec.secrets, you
can use an include statement however to break the files up.</p>
<h2><a name="Manual connection keying">Manual connection keying</a></h2>
<p>First we&#146;ll set up a link using manual keying (for
simplicity), you will need to edit ipsec.conf, and your firewall
rules. Most of the defaults in the ipsec.conf file are fine but
you will need to change the following:</p>
<pre>conn sample
type=tunnel
left=
leftnexthop=
leftsubnet=
right=
rightnexthop=
rightsubnet=
spibase=0x200
esp=3des-md5-96
espenckey=
espauthkey=&nbsp;</pre>
<p>replace the espenckey and espauthkey with new keys (using
ranbits to generate a number, remember to leave the leading 0x
that specifies it is a hex number) so that it looks like:</p>
<pre>conn my-tunnel
type=tunnel
left=1.2.3.4
leftnexthop=1.2.3.1
leftsubnet=10.0.0.0/24
right=5.6.7.8
rightnexthop=5.6.7.1
rightsubnet=192.168.0.0/24
spibase=0x200
esp=3des-md5-96
espenckey=some_auth_key_here (ranbits 192)
espauthkey=some_other_key_here (ranbits 128)&nbsp;</pre>
<p>Once you have done this copy the files ipsec.conf and
ipsec.secrets from the machine you edited them on to the other
server in a secure manner. Now all that remains to be done is the
addition of some firewall rules so that packets do not get
masqueraded (instead we simply want them forwarded).</p>
<p>On Server 1.2.3.4 you should add the following rules:</p>
<pre>ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 10.0.0.0/24&nbsp;</pre>
<p>make sure these rules appear before the masquerading rule, it
should look like this:</p>
<pre>#
# FORWARD RULES
#
ipchains -P forward DENY
#
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 10.0.0.0/24
ipchains -A forward -p all -j MASQ -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0&nbsp;</pre>
<p>And on server 5.6.7.8 you basically repeat the process:</p>
<pre>ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 10.0.0.0/24
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24&nbsp;</pre>
<p>make sure these rules appear before the masquerading rule, it
should look like this:</p>
<pre>#
# FORWARD RULES
#
ipchains -P forward DENY
#
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 10.0.0.0/24
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24
ipchains -A forward -p all -j MASQ -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0&nbsp;</pre>
<p>Now you should be able to bring up the ipsec tunnel on both
machines manually and the machines on Network A should be able to
talk to the machines on Network B with no problems.</p>
<pre>ipsec manual &#150;up my-tunnel&nbsp;</pre>
<p>and it should produce output similar to:</p>
<pre>/usr/local/lib/ipsec/spi: message size is 36
/usr/local/lib/ipsec/spi: message size is 132
/usr/local/lib/ipsec/spi: message size is 132&nbsp;</pre>
<p>To test it try pinging 192.168.0.2 from the 10.0.0.2 client.
If this works then you have set it up correctly. If it does not
work check your network to make sure 1.2.3.4 can reach 5.6.7.8,
and that TCP-IP forwarding is enabled, and make sure that no
firewall rules are blocking the packets, or trying to masquerade
them. Once you have established a connection and tested it
successfully you should move to automatic keying (especially if
it&#146;s in a production environment).</p>
<h2><a name="Automatic connection keying">Automatic connection
keying</a></h2>
<p>If you intend to use IPSec in a production environment, manual
keying is a bad idea generally speaking. With automatic keying
you have a 256 bit shared secret you copy to both ends of the
tunnel, which is then used during the key exchanges to make sure
a man in the middle attack does not occur. With automatic keying
the default lifetime of a key is 8 hours, which you can set to
anything you like, and if someone manages to brute force the key,
it is only good for that 8 hour chunk of traffic. The following
example builds on the previous one:</p>
<p>ipsec.secrets contains the shared secret. This file must be
kept secure at all costs. For a connection between the 1.2.3.4
and 5.6.7.8 servers you would need a line like:</p>
<pre>1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8 &#147;0xa3afb7e6_20f10d66_03760ef1_9019c643_a73c7ce0_91e46e84_ef6281b9_812392bf&#148;</pre>
<p>This line needs to be in the ipsec.secrets file of both
computers. You would then need to edit the tunnel configuration
in ipsec.conf to the following:</p>
<pre>conn my-tunnel
type=tunnel
left=1.2.3.4
leftnexthop=1.2.3.1
leftsubnet=10.0.0.0/24
right=5.6.7.8
rightnexthop=5.6.7.1
rightsubnet=192.168.0.0/24
keyexchange=ike
keylife=8h
keyingtries=0</pre>
<p>The pluto daemon will then startup, try to connect to the
Pluto daemon at the other end of the tunnel, and establish a
connection. One caveat, Pluto runs on port 500, UDP, so chances
are you will have to poke a hole in your firewall to allow it
through:</p>
<pre>ipchains -A input -p udp -j ACCEPT -s 0.0.0.0/0 -i eth0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 500</pre>
<p>I find it convenient to use the &#147;%search&#148; keyword
instead of listing the tunnel to bring up, by adding:</p>
<pre>auto=start</pre>
<p>to each tunnel configuration and editing ipsec.secrets:</p>
<pre>plutoload=%search
plutostart=%search</pre>
<p>This will make your life generally easier in the long run. If
all goes well you should see something like this in
/var/log/messages:</p>

<p>In our example we will have the following network setup:</p>

IP address 1.2.3.4, and eth1 is attached to the internal network
and has the IP address 10.0.0.1.</p>

<p>Network B is the network &#145;behind&#146; Server B and
consists of machines on the 192.168.0.* subnet.</p>
<p>Network C is the Internet, to which Server A and B are
connected (by T1, let&#146;s be generous).</p>
<p><strong>Basic server setup</strong></p>
<p>Each machine will have Red Hat Linux 6.1 installed, with the
default kernel 2.2.12, make sure you install ipchains, by default
this does not usually get installed. Any other software on the
machines is incidental (we are primarily concerned about moving
packets and such).</p>
<p>Go to ftp.linux.org (or your favourite mirror) and download
the full Linux kernel 2.2.10. Go to /usr/src/ and remove the
existing linux symlink, unpack kernel 2.2.10 and mv it to
/usr/src/linux-2.2.10, and recreate the &quot;linux&quot; symlink
to point to it. Then cd into /usr/src/linux, configure the
kernel, compile and install it. Make sure you choose all the IP
masquerading items, and where possible compile them in as static
components, and not modules. Remember to use &quot;make
bzImage&quot;, as chances are the new kernel will be to large for
lilo to load normally.</p>

<p>Now we need to edit lilo.conf, rerun lilo, and reboot to make

make sure your network works first before even attempting to

<p>then reboot and you should be running kernel 2.2.10.</p>

should be masquerading the internal machines and using a default

<p>Remember to put these rules last in your firewalling script.
You will also need to enable packet forwarding, edit the
/etc/sysconfig/network and replace the line:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">FORWARD_IPV4=&quot;no&quot;</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>with the line:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">FORWARD_IPV4=&quot;yes&quot;</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>You should now be able to ping Server B from Network A (ping
5.6.7.8), and you should also be able to ping Server A from
Network B (ping 1.2.3.4).</p>
<p>Assuming all this works we can now attempt to install the IP
Security software.</p>
<p><strong>IPSec installation</strong></p>
<p>Download the latest IPSec snapshot (version 1.0 will NOT work
with 2.2.x kernels). Then go to /usr/local/src (or wherever),
unpack the source and run the install program (make menugo
typically for the ncurses based configuration). This will patch
the kernel files, then run the kernel configuration, and then
build the IPSec tools, and the kernel.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">cd /usr/local/src/<br>
tar &#150;zvvxf /path/to/tarball/snapshot.tar.gz<br>
chown &#150;R root:root freeswan-snap1999Jun14b<br>
cd freeswan-snap1999Jun14b<br>
make menugo</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>make sure you save the kernel configuration, even though the
options are chosen they have not been saved. You will also have
to rebuild the kernel as the &quot;make menugo&quot; command runs
a &quot;make zImage&quot; which usually fails due to the large
kernel sizes with 2.2.x. Once the compile is done it should have
an error message or two, simply:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">cd /usr/src/linux<br>
make bzImage<br>
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage
/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.10-ipsec</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>Now we need to edit lilo.conf, rerun lilo, and reboot to make
use of the new kernel. </p>
<p>Lilo.conf should look like:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">boot=/dev/hda<br>
map=/boot/map<br>
install=/boot/boot.b<br>
prompt<br>
timeout=100<br>
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.10-ipsec<br>
label=linux-ipsec<br>
root=/dev/hda1<br>
read-only<br>
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.10<br>
label=linux<br>
root=/dev/hda1<br>
read-only</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>rerun lilo and you should see:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">linux-ipsec *<br>
linux</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>then reboot and you should be running kernel 2.2.10 with IPSec
support. As the machine reboots and starts the IPSec stuff you
will see several errors, by default IPSec is set to use the
eth999 interface, which of course does not exist. You should also
add /usr/local/lib/ipsec to your path statement or else you will
have to type the full path in a lot.</p>
<p>Configuring IPSec</p>
<p>We will initially use manual keying (i.e. for now we will
ignore the pluto IKE daemon) as this makes life simpler. You will
need to edit ipsec.conf and ipsec.conf. These two files will then
need to be copied to the other server in a secure manner (ssh,
floppy disk, etc.).</p>
<p>Here is a diagram of the network:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to edit the ipsec.conf file, most of the
defaults are fine but you will need to change the following:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">conn sample<br>

# left security gateway (public-network address)<br>

# (manual) encryption/authentication algorithm and
parameters to it<br>
esp=3des-md5-96<br>
espenckey=<br>
espauthkey=</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>replace the espenckey and espauthkey with new keys (using
ranbits to generate a number, remmeber to leave the leading 0x
that specifies it is a hex number) so that it looks like:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">conn my-tunnel<br>
type=tunnel<br>
# left security gateway (public-network address)<br>

# subnet behind left (omit if there is no subnet)<br>
leftsubnet=10.0.0.0/24<br>
# right s.g., subnet behind it, and next hop to reach

esp=3des-md5-96<br>
espenckey=some_auth_key_here (ranbits 192)<br>
espauthkey=some_other_key_here (ranbits 128)</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>Once you have done this copy the files ipsec.conf and
ipsec.secrets from the machine you edited them on to the other
server in a secure manner. Now all that remains to be done is the
addition of some firewall rules so that packets do not get
masqueraded (instead we simply want them forwarded).</p>
<p>On Server A you should add the following rules:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s
10.0.0.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24<br>
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d
10.0.0.0/24</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>make sure these rules appear before the masquerading rule, it
should look like this:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">#<br>
# FORWARD RULES<br>
#<br>
ipchains -P forward DENY<br>
#<br>
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d
192.168.0.0/24<br>
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d
10.0.0.0/24<br>
ipchains -A forward -p all -j MASQ -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d
0.0.0.0/0</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>And on server B you basically repeat the process:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s
192.168.0.0/24 -d 10.0.0.0/24<br>
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d
192.168.0.0/24</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>make sure these rules appear before the masquerading rule, it
should look like this:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">#<br>
# FORWARD RULES<br>
#<br>
ipchains -P forward DENY<br>
#<br>
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d
10.0.0.0/24<br>
ipchains -A forward -p all -j ACCEPT -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d
192.168.0.0/24<br>
ipchains -A forward -p all -j MASQ -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d
0.0.0.0/0</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p><strong>Starting up your connection</strong></p>
<p>Now you should be able to bring up the ipsec tunnel on both
machines manually and the machines on Network A should be able to
talk to the machines on Network B with no problems.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">ipsec manual &#150;up my-tunnel</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>and it should produce output similar to:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<TBODY> <tr>
<td valign="top">/usr/local/lib/ipsec/spi: message size
is 36<br>
/usr/local/lib/ipsec/spi: message size is 132<br>
/usr/local/lib/ipsec/spi: message size is 132</td>
</tr>
</TBODY></table>
<p>To test it try pinging 192.168.0.2 from the 10.0.0.2 client
(you cannot ping from 192.168.0.1 to 10.0.0.1 or the external
gateway addresses since you have not configured tunnels to handle
those packets). If this works then you have set it up correctly.</p>
