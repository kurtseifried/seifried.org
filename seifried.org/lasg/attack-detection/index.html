<p>No matter how good your security is you it can be compromised.
That is why it is so important to have various forms of attack
detection present, so that when an incident happens you are
alerted to it as soon as possible (and not when you start getting
complaints from other sites).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Baselines</h2>
<p>One major oversight made by a lot of people when securing
their machines is that they forget to create a baseline of the
system, that is a profile of the system, its usage of resources,
and so on in normal operation. For example something as simple as
a &quot;netstat -a -n &gt; netstat-output&quot; can give you a
reference to latter check against and see if any ports are open
that should not be. Memory usage and disk usage are also good
things to keep an eye on. A sudden surge in memory usage could
result in the system being starved of resources. Likewise for
disk usage. It might be a user accident, a malicious user, or a
worm program that has compromised your system and is now scanning
other systems. Various tools exist to measure memory and disk
usage: vmstat, free, df, du, all of which are covered by their
respective man pages.</p>
<p>At the very minimum make a full system backup, and regularly
backup config files and log files, this can also help you
pinpoint when an intrusion occurred (user account
&quot;rewt&quot; was added before the April 4th backup, but isn't
in the March 20th backup). Once a system is compromised typically
a &quot;rootkit&quot; is installed, these consist of trojaned
binaries, and are near impossible to remove safely, you are
better of formatting the disk and starting from scratch. There is
of course a notable exception to this rule, if you were diligent
and used file/directory integrity tools such as L5 you will be
able to pinpoint the affected files easily and deal with them.</p>
<p>There are also a variety of tools that do not quite fit under
the headings here, but are aimed at attack detection. One is the
Linux Intrusion Detection System (LIDS) project, <a href="../kernel/index.html#LIDS">more information is listed here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>File system monitoring</h2>
<p>So you've secured your machines, and done all the things that
needed to be done. So how do you make sure it's actually doing
what it is supposed to do, or prove to someone that it is as
secure as you say it is? Well you conduct an audit. This can be
as simple as reviewing the installed software, configuration
files and other settings, or as complex as putting together or
hiring a tiger team (or ethical hackers, or whatever buzzword(s)
you prefer) to actively try and penetrate your security. If they
can't then you did your job well (or they suck), and if they do
get in, you know what needs to be fixed (this is also a good
method to show the CIO that security is not a one shot affair, it
is a constant battle). One thing almost all attackers do is
modify system files, once you detect a break in, how do you know
which files are ok and which are not? Short of a complete
reinstall the only way to be sure (and even then it's not always
100%) is to use software to create signatures of files that
cannot be forged so you can compare them later on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tripwire</h3>
<p>Tripwire is no longer a open source tool. I have absolutely NO
problems with commercial software. However, when you expect me to
rely on a program to provide security, when I (nor anyone else
really) can not view the source (it is available under some
special license agreement, probably an NDA) I must decline.
Tripwire costs approximately $70 for Linux, and is only available
as an RPM package aimed at Red Hat Linux (tripwire is $500 for
other operating systems). I feel this is rather on the high side
for a piece of software that can easily be replaced with
alternatives such as L5 or Gog&amp;Magog. Tripwire is available <a href="http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/">http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/</a>.
There is also the &quot;classic&quot; version available <a href="http://www.tripwire.org/">http://www.tripwire.org/</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>AIDE</h3>
<p>AIDE is a tripwire replacement that attempts to be better then
tripwire. It is GPL licensed which makes it somewhat more
desirable then tripwire from a trust point of view. It supports
several hashing algorithms, and you can download <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html">http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>ViperDB&nbsp;</h3>
<p>ViperDB checks setuid/setgid programs and folders and can
notify you (via syslog) of any changes or reset their permissions
and ownership to what they should be. ViperDB creates a series of
databases (flat text files actually) in the directory root, i.e.:
/etc/.ViperDB might contain:</p>
<pre>/etc/login.defs,1180,-,root,rw-,root,r--,r--,Apr,15,18:03
/etc/minicom.users,1048,-,root,rw-,root,r--,r--,Mar,21,19:11
/etc/CORBA,1024,d,root,rwx,root,r-x,r-x,Jun,14,16:51
/etc/X11,1024,d,root,rwx,root,r-x,r-x,Jun,14,23:05
/etc/cron.d,1024,d,root,rwx,root,r-x,r-x,Apr,14,17:09</pre>
<p>Unfortunately ViperDB doesn&#146;t seem to handle sub
directories, so you will have to add them to the viperdb.ini file
with something like:</p>
<pre>find /etc/ -type d &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/viperdb.ini</pre>
<p>viperdb.pl has 3 options, -init (creates a set of databases),
-check (checks files against databases, sends any messages to
syslog, and then recreates the databases) and &#150;checkstrict
(checks files against databases, resets permissions if necessary,
sends any messages to syslog, and then recreates the databases).
What this means is if you use &#150;check, you will get a warning
that say /etc/passwd is now world writeable, and since it
recreates the databases the next time you run viperdb you will
NOT get a warning. I would advise running viperdb is
&#150;checkstrict mode only, and make sure you run viperdb with
the &#150;init option after manipulating any file / folder
permissions in protected directories. ViperDB is available <a href="http://www.resentment.org/projects/viperdb/">http://www.resentment.org/projects/viperdb/</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pikt</h3>
<p>Pikt is an extremely interesting tool, it is actually more of
a scripting language aimed at system administration then a simple
program. Pikt allows you to do things such as killing off idle
user processes, enforcing mail quotas, monitor the system for
suspicious usage patterns (off hours, etc), and much more. About
the only problem with Pikt will be a steep learning tools, as it
uses it&#146;s own scripting language, but ultimately I think
mastering this language will pay off if you have many systems to
administer (especially since Pikt runs on Solaris, Linux and
FreeBSD currently). Pikt is available <a href="http://pikt.uchicago.edu/pikt/">http://pikt.uchicago.edu/pikt/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>Something people forget about, but you can compare the current
files to old backups, many backup formats (Tape, floppy, CDR,
etc.) can be made read only, so a backup of a newly installed
system provides a good benchmark to compare things to. The
utility &#147;diff&#148; and &#147;cmp&#148; can be used to
compare files against each other. <a href="../backups/index.html">See
the backup section</a> for a full listing of free and commercial
software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Network monitoring / attack detection</h2>
<p>If the last section has you worried you should be. There are
however many defenses, active and passive against those types of
attacks. The best ways to combat network scans are keep software
up to date, only run what is needed, and heavily restrict the
rest through the use of firewalls and other mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily in Linux these tools are free and easily available,
again I will only cover open source tools, since the idea of a
proprietary firewall/etc is rather worrying. The first line of
defense should be a robust firewall, followed by packet filters
on all Internet accessible machines, liberal use of TCP-WRAPPERS,
logging and more importantly automated software to examine the
logs for you (it is unfeasible for an administrator to read log
files nowadays).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DTK</h3>
<p>The Deception ToolKit is a set of programs that emulate well
known services in order to provide a false set of readings to
attackers. The hope is to confuse and slow down attackers by
leading them to false conclusions, you can download DTK from <a href="http://all.net/dtk/">http://all.net/dtk/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Psionic TriSentry - PortSentry, HostSentry and LogSentry</h3>
<p>Psionic TriSentry consists of three components, PortSentry,
HostSentry and LogSentry. PortSentry detects and logs port scans,
including stealthy scans (basically anything nmap can do it
should be able to detect). Psionic PortSentry can be configured
to block the offending machine (in my opinion a bad idea as it
could be used for a denial of service attack on legitimate
hosts), making completion of a port scan difficult. As this tool
is in beta I would recommend against using it, however with some
age it should mature into a solid and useful tool. HostSentry
spots local anomolous behaviour in user accounts, and reports
situations that fall outside of normal parameters (i.e. Bob from
accounting logging in at 2 AM on a Sunday). The last component is
LogSentry, essentially a log file monitoring applications which
will alert you if it spots strange problems. TriSentry is
available <a href="http://www.psionic.com/products/">http://www.psionic.com/products/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>scanlogd</h3>
<p>scanlogd monitors network packets and if a threshold is
exceeded it logs the packets. You can get it at: <a href="http://www.openwall.com/scanlogd/">http://www.openwall.com/scanlogd/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Firewalls</h3>
<p>Most firewalls support logging of data, and ipfwadm/ipchains
are no exception, using the -l switch you get a syslog entry for
each packet, using automated filters (Perl is good for this) you
can detect trends/hostile attempts and so on. Since most
firewalls (UNIX based, and Cisco in any case) log via the syslog
facility, you can easily centralize all your firewall packet
logging on a single host (with a lot of harddrive space
hopefully).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TCP-WRAPPERS</h3>
<p>Wietse's TCP-WRAPPERS allow you to restrict connections to
various services based on IP address and so forth, but even more
importantly it allows you to configure a response, you can have
it email you, finger the offending machine, and so on (use with
caution however). TCP_WRAPPERS comes standard with most
distributions and is available <a href="ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/">ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Intrusion Detection Papers</h2>
<p>FAQ: Network Intrusion Detection Systems, an excellent FAQ
that covers all the major (and many minor) issues with IDS
systems. Available <a href="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/network-intrusion-detection.html">http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/network-intrusion-detection.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dealing with attacks</h2>
<p>So you've done your homework, you installed tripwire, DTK, and
so on. Now what do you do when your pager starts going off at 3am
and tells you that someone just made changes on the primary NIS
server? Dealing with an attack depends on several factors, is the
attack in progress? Did you discover your company plan being sent
out by the mail server to a Hotmail address? Did you get called
in to find a cluster of dead servers? What are your priorities?
Restoring service? Ensuring confidential data is safe?
Prosecuting the attacker(s)? Several things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Response from the admin will depend heavily on the
environment they are in. The attacker may have
compromised the administrative accounts, so sending email
may not work.</li>
<li>Most sites usually don't want to report attacks
(successful or not) due to the potential embarrassment
and related public relations problems.</li>
<li>Most quick attacks, denial of service attacks and the
like are spoofed. Tracking down the real attacker is very
difficult and resource intensive.</li>
<li>Even if all goes well there is a chance law enforcement
will seize your equipment as evidence, and hold it, not
something to be taken lightly.</li>
<li>Do you know how the attacker got in (i.e. NFR recorded
it), if so you might just want to plug the holes and go
on.</li>
<li>Try not to ignore attacks, but at the same time there are
many people running garbage attacks in an effort to waste
administrators time and energy (and possibly distract
them from more subtle attacks).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also before you deal with an attack, you should consult your
company policy. If you don't have one consult your manager, the
legal department, etc. It's also a good idea to have a game plan
to deal with attacks (i.e., the mail server is first priority,
checking fileservers is number two, who do you notify, etc) this
will prevent a lot of problems when it happens (be prepared). The
O'Reilly book <a href="http://www.ora.com/catalog/puis/">&#147;Practical
Unix and Internet Security&#148;</a> covers this topic in great
detail so I&#146;m not going to rehash it. Go buy the book. There
is also &quot;Incident response&quot; from O'Reilly, you should
probably read it, it's quite good.</p>
<p>An excellent whitepaper on this is also available, see <a href="../appendices/index.html">Appendix D</a>, &#147;How to
Handle and Identify Network Probes&#148;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Packet sniffers</h2>
<p>Packet sniffing is the practice of capturing network data not
destined for your machine, typically for the purpose of viewing
confidential/sensitive traffic such as telnet sessions or people
reading their email. Unfortunately there is no real reliable way
to detect a packet sniffer since it is mostly a passive activity,
however by utilizing network switches and fiber optic backbones
(which are very difficult to tap) you can minimize the threat.
There is also a tool called AntiSniff, that probes network
devices and sees if their response indicates an interface in
promiscuous mode. These tools are also invaluable if your network
is under attack and you want to see what is going on. There is an
excellent FAQ on sniffing <a href="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/sniffing-faq.html">http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/sniffing-faq.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Snort</h3>
<p>Snort is the king of packet sniffers now. It can also be used
to detect various attacks. It can watch for activity such as
Queso TCP-IP fingerprinting scans, Nmap scans, and the like.
Snort is available <a href="http://www.snort.org/">http://www.snort.org/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>tcpdump</h3>
<p>The granddaddy of packet sniffers for Linux, this tool has
existed as long as I can remember, and is of primary use for
debugging network problems. It is not very configurable and lacks
advanced features of newer packet sniffers, but it can be useful.
Most distributions ships with tcpdump.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ethereal</h3>
<p>A nice looking network protocol analyzer (a.k.a., a souped up
sniffer) with an interface very similar to NT&#146;s network
monitor. It allows easy viewing of data payloads for most network
protocols (tftp, http, Netbios, etc). It is based on GTK, thus
meaning you will probably have to be running gnome to use it. I
haven't tested it yet (but intend to). It is available <a href="http://www.ethereal.com/">http://www.ethereal.com/</a>.
Ethereal can also be used to open trace files from other
software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SPY</h3>
<p>SPY is an advanced multi protocol sniffer that runs on various
platforms. You can get it <a href="http://www.gromeck.de/Spy/">http://www.gromeck.de/Spy/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other sniffers</h3>
<p>There are a variety of packet sniffers for Linux, based on the
libpcap library among others, here is a short list:</p>
<p>Numerous other packet sniffers are available <a href="http://freshmeat.net/search/?site=Freshmeat&amp;q=packet+sniff&amp;section=projects">http://freshmeat.net/search/?site=Freshmeat&amp;q=packet+sniff&amp;section=projects</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Packet sniffer detection</h2>
<p>In theory most operating systems leave tell tale signs when
packet sniffing (that is to say their network interfaces respond
in certain, non standard ways to network traffic). If the
attacker is not to savvy, or is using a compromised machine then
chances are you can detect them. On the other hand if they are
using a specially built cable, or induction ring there is no
chance of detecting them unless you trace every physical piece of
network cable and check what is plugged into it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>AntiSniff</h3>
<p>As mentioned before AntiSniff i a tool that probes network
devices to try and see if they are running in promiscuous mode,
as opposed to normal modes of operation. It is supposedly
effective, and will work against most sniffers. You can get it <a href="http://www.securitysoftwaretech.com/antisniff/">http://www.securitysoftwaretech.com/antisniff/</a>.
AntiSniff has not been maintained in over a year. </p>
