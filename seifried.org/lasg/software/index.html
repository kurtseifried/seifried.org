<h2><a name="RPM&nbsp;">RPM&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>RPM is a software management tool originally created by Red
Hat, and later GNU'ed and given to the public (<a href="http://www.rpm.org/">http://www.rpm.org/</a>).
It forms the core of administration on most systems, since one of
the major tasks for any administrator is installing and keeping
software up to date. Various estimates place most of the blame
for security break-ins on bad passwords, and old software with
known vulnerabilities. This isn't exactly surprising one would
think, but while the average server contains 200-400 software
packages on average, one begins to see why keeping software up to
date can be a major task.</p>
<p>The man page for RPM is pretty bad, there is no nice way of
putting it. The book &quot;Maximum RPM&quot; (ISBN:
0-672-31105-4) on the other hand is really wonderful (freely
available at <a href="http://www.rpm.org/">http://www.rpm.org/</a>
in post script format). I would suggest this book for any Red Hat
administrator, and can say safely that it is required reading if
you plan to build RPM packages. The basics of RPM are pretty self
explanatory, packages come in an rpm format, with a simple
filename convention:</p>
<pre>package_name-package_version-rpm_build_version-architecture.rpm</pre>
<pre>nfs-server-2.2beta29-5.i386.rpm</pre>
<p>would be &#147;nfs-server&#148;, version &#147;2.2beta29&#148;
of &#147;nfs-server&#148;, the fifth build of that rpm (i.e. it
has been packaged and built 5 times, minor modifications, changes
in file locations, etc.), for the Intel architecture, and
it&#146;s an rpm file.</p>

Red Hat Linux 5.1 shipped with 528 packages, and Red Hat Linux
5.2 shipped with 573, which when you think about it is a heck of
a lot of software (SuSE 6.0 ships on 5 CD's, I haven&#146;t
bothered to count how many packages). Typically you will end up
with 2-300 packages installed (more apps on workstations, servers
tend to be leaner, but this is not always the case). So which of
these should you install and which should you avoid if possible
(like the r services packages). One thing I will say, the RPM's
that ship with Red Hat distributions are usually pretty good, and
typically last 6-12 months before they are found to be broken.</p>
<p>There is a list of URL's and mailing lists where distribution
specific errata and updates are available later on in this
document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="dpkg">dpkg</a></h2>
<p>The Debian package system is a similar package to RPM, however
lacks some of the functionality, although overall it does an
excellent job of managing software packages on a system. Combined
with the dselect utility (being phased out) you can connect to
remote sites, scroll through the available packages, install
them, run any configuration scripts needed (like say for gpm),
all from the comfort of your console. The man page for dpkg
&quot;man dpkg&quot; is quite extensive.</p>
<p>The general format of a Debian package file (.deb) is:</p>
<pre>packagename_packageversion-debversion.deb</pre>
<pre>ncftp2_2.4.3-2.deb</pre>
<p>Unlike rpm files .deb files are not labeled for architecture
as well (not a big deal but something to be aware of).</p>
<p>Command Function:<br>
-I Queries Package<br>
-i Install software<br>
-l List installed software (equiv. to rpm -qa)<br>
-r Removes the software from the system</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

<p>&nbsp;<br>
Debian has 1500+ packages available with the system. You will
learn to love dpkg (functionally it has everything necessary, I
just miss a few of the bells and whistles that rpm has, on the
other hand dselect has some features I wish rpm had).</p>
<p>There is a list of URL's and mailing lists where distribution

<h2><a name="tarballs / tgz&nbsp;">tarballs / tgz&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>Most modern Linux distributions use a package management
system to install, keep track of and remove software on the
system. There are however many exceptions, Slackware does not use
a true package management system per se, but instead has
precompiled tarballs (a compressed tar file containing files)
that you simply unpack from the root directory to install, some
of which have install script to handle any post install tasks
such as adding a user. These packages can also be removed, but
functions such as querying, comparing installed files against
packages files (trying to find tampering, etc.) is pretty much
not there. Or perhaps you want to try the latest copy of X, and
no-one has yet gotten around to making a nice .rpm or .deb file,
so you must grab the source code (also usually in a compressed
tarball), unpack it and install it. This present no more real
danger then a package as most tarballs have MD5 and/or PGP
signatures associated with them you can download and check. The
real security concern with these is the difficulty in sometimes
tracking down whether or not you have a certain piece of software
installed, determining the version, and then removing or
upgrading it. I would advise against using tarballs if at all
possible, if you must use them it is a good idea to make a list
of files on the system before you install it, and one afterwards,
and then compare them using 'diff' to find out what file it
placed where. Simply run 'find /* &gt; /filelist.txt' before and
'find /* &gt; /filelist2.txt' after you install the tarball, and
use 'diff -q /filelist.txt /filelist2.txt &gt; /difflist.txt' to
get a list of what changed. Alternatively a 'tar -tf blah.tar'
will list the contents of the file, but like most tarballs you'll
be running an executable install script/compiling and installing
the software, so a simple file listing will not give you an
accurate picture of what was installed or modified. Another
method for keeping track of what you have installed via tar is to
use a program such as &#145;stow&#146;, stow installs the package
to a separate directory (/opt/stow/) for example and then creates
links from the system to that directory as appropriate. Stow
requires that you have Perl installed and is available from: <a href="http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/software/stow/stow.html">http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/software/stow/stow.html</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Checking file integrity">Checking file integrity</a></h2>
<p>Something I thought I would cover semi-separately is checking
the integrity of software that is retrieved from remote sites.
Usually people don&#146;t worry, but recently ftp.win.tue.nl was
broken into, and the TCP_WRAPPERS package (among others) was
trojaned. 59 downloads occurred before the site removed the
offending packages and initiated damage control procedures. You
should always check the integrity of files you download from
remote sites, some day a major site will be broken into and a lot
of people will suffer a lot of grief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RPM integrity</h3>
<p>RPM packages can (and typically are) PGP signed by the author.
This signature can be checked to ensure the package has not been
tampered with or is a trojaned version. This is described in
great deal in chapter 7 of &#147;Maximum RPM&#148; (online at <a href="http://www.rpm.org/">http://www.rpm.org/</a>),
but consists of adding the developers keys to your public PGP
keyring, and then using the &#150;K option which will grab the
appropriate key from the keyring and verify the signature. This
way, to trojan a package and sign it correctly, they would have
to steal the developers private PGP key and the password to
unlock it, which should be near impossible.</p>
<p>Be warned however there are some potential problems if you do
not configure RPM correctly. Please see this security advisory:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seifried.org/security/advisories/kssa-001.html">https://www.seifried.org/security/advisories/kssa-001.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>dpkg integrity</h3>
<p>dpkg supports MD5, so you must somehow get the MD5 signatures
through a trusted channel (like PGP signed email). MD5 ships with
most distributions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PGP signed files</h3>
<p>Many tarballs are distributed with PGP signatures in separate
ASCII files, to verify them add the developers key to your
keyring and then use PGP with the &#150;o option. This way to
trojan a package and sign it correctly, they would have to steal
the developers private PGP key and the password to unlock it,
which should be near impossible. PGP for Linux is available from:
<a href="ftp://ftp.zedz.net/">ftp://ftp.zedz.net/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>GnuPG signed files</h3>
<p>Also used is GnuPG, a completely open source version of PGP
that uses no patented algorithms. You can get it from: <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">http://www.gnupg.org/</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MD5 signed files</h3>
<p>Another way of signing a package is to create an MD5 checksum.
The reason MD5 would be used at all (since anyone could create a
valid MD5 signature of a trojaned software package) is that MD5
is pretty much universal and not controlled by export laws. The
weakness is you must somehow distribute the MD5 signatures in
advance securely, and this is usually done via email when a
package is announced (vendors such as Sun do this for patches).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Automating software updates">Automating software
updates</a></h2>
<h3>NSBD</h3>
<p>NSBD (not-so-bad-distribution) is a method to autmatically
distribute and update software securely over the network. You can
get it from: <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/project/nsbd/">http://www.bell-labs.com/project/nsbd/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Automating updates with RPM">Automating updates with
RPM</a></h2>
<h3>AutoRPM</h3>
<p>AutoRPM is probably the best tool for keeping rpm&#146;s up to
date, simply put you point it at an ftp directory, and it
downloads and installs any packages that are newer then the ones
you have. Please keep in mind however if someone poisons your DNS
cache you will be easily compromised, so make sure you use the
ftp site&#146;s IP address and not its name. Also you should
consider pointing it at an internal ftp site with packages you
have tested, and have tighter control over. AutoRPM requires that
you install the libnet package Net::FTP for Perl and is available
from: <a href="http://www.kaybee.org/~kirk/html/linux.html">http://www.kaybee.org/~kirk/html/linux.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RpmWatch</h3>
<p>RpmWatch is a simple Perl script that will install updates for
you, note it will not suck down the packages you need so you must
mirror them locally, or make them accessible locally via
something like NFS or CODA. RpmWatch is available from: <a href="http://www.iaehv.nl/users/grimaldo/info/scripts/">http://www.iaehv.nl/users/grimaldo/info/scripts/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Automating updates with dpkg">Automating updates
with dpkg</a></h2>
<p>Debian's software package management tools (dpkg and apt-get)
support automated updates of packages and all their dependancies
from a network ftp server. Simple create a script that is called
by cron once a day (or more often if you are paranoid) that does:</p>
<p>#!/bin/bash<br>
PATH=/usr/bin<br>
apt-get update<br>
apt-get upgrade</p>
<p>The only additional thing you will need to do is configure
your download sites in /etc/apt/sources.list and general apt
configuration in /etc/apt/apt.conf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Automating updates with tarballs / tgz">Automating
updates with tarballs / tgz</a></h2>
<p>No tools found, please tell me if you know of any (although
beyond mirroring, automatically unpacking and running
&#147;./configure ; make ; make install&#148;, nothing really
comes to mind, i.e. a ports collection similar to BSD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Tracking software installation">Tracking software
installation</a></h2>
<p>Usually when software installs from a source install as
opposed to a package it has a tendency to go all over the place.
Removing it can be an extremely troublesome task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>instmon</h3>
<p>instmon is run before and after you install a tarball / tgz
package (or any package for that matter). It generates a list of
files changed that you can later use to undo any changes. It is
available from: <a href="http://hal.csd.auth.gr/~vvas/instmon/">http://hal.csd.auth.gr/~vvas/instmon/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Converting file formats">Converting file formats</a></h2>
<p>Another way to deal with packages/etc. is to convert them.
There are several utilities to convert rpm files to tarballs,
rpm&#146;s to deb&#146;s, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>alien</h3>
<p>alien is probably the best utility around for converting
files, it handles rpm&#146;s, deb&#146;s and tarballs very well.
You can download it from: <a href="http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/">http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Finding software">Finding software</a></h2>
<p>One major problem with Linux is finding software that did not
ship with your distribution. Searching the Internet is a pain.
There are some resources however that can ease the pain:</p>

<h2><a name="Secure programming">Secure programming</a></h2>
<p>This whole guide exists because Linux and the software running
on Linux systems is either insecurely written, or insecurely
setup. Many issues, such as buffer overruns, are due to bad
programming and carelessness. These problems become especially
bad when the software in question is setuid to run as root, or
any other privileged group. There are a variety of techniques,
and other measures that can be taken to make software safer.</p>
