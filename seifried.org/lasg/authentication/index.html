<p>Authentication is typically one of the two main lines of
defense that systems and networks rely upon, so ensuring that
your authentication subsystems are implemented correctly is
important. The majority of Linux systems rely on usernames and
passwords, while support for tokens, smartcards and other
authentication systems are available they are still relatively
rare. On top of this sits PAM, as far as I know all major vendors
use PAM by default, so understanding how PAM works and using it
correctly is very important. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PAM</h2>
<p>&quot;Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux is a suite of
shared libraries that enable the local system administrator to
choose how applications authenticate users.&quot; Straight from
the PAM documentation, I don't think I could have said it any
better. But what does this actually mean? For example; take the
program &#147;login&#148;, when a user connects to a tty (via a
serial port or over the network) a program answers the call
(getty for serial lines, telnet or SSH for network connections)
and starts up a login program, login then typically requests a
username, followed by a password, which it checks against the
/etc/passwd file. This is all fine and dandy until you have a
spiffy new digital card authentication system and want to use it.
Well you will have to recompile login (and any other apps that
will do authentication via the new method) so they support the
new system. As you can imagine this is quite laborious and prone
to errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PAM introduces a layer of middleware between the application
and the actual authentication mechanism. Once a program is
PAM'ified, any authentication methods PAM supports will be usable
by the program. In addition to this PAM can handle account, and
session data which is something normal authentication mechanisms
don't do very well. For example using PAM you can easily disallow
login access by normal users between 6pm and 6am, and when they
do login you can have them authenticate via a retinal scanner. By
default Red Hat systems are PAM aware, and newer versions of
Debian are as well (see bellow for a table of PAM&#146;ified
systems). Thus on a system with PAM support all I have to do to
implement shadow passwords is convert the password and group
files; and possibly add one or two lines to some PAM config files
(if they weren't already added). Essentially, PAM gives you a
great deal of flexibility when handling user authentication, and
will support other features in the future such as digital
signatures with the only requirement being a PAM module or two to
handle it. This kind of flexibility will be required if Linux is
to be an enterprise-class operating system. Distributions that do
not ship as &quot;PAM-aware&quot; can be made so but it requires
a lot of effort (you must recompile all your programs with PAM
support, install PAM, etc), it is probably easier to switch
straight to a PAM'ified distribution if this will be a
requirement. PAM usually comes with complete documentation, and
if you are looking for a good overview you go <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/pam/">http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/pam/</a>.</p>
<p>Other benefits of a PAM aware system is that you can now make
use of an NT domain to do your user authentication, meaning you
can tie Linux workstations into an existing Microsoft based
network without having to say buy NIS / NIS+ for NT and go
through the hassle of installing that. As far as I know all
modern Linux distributions have PAM support and default to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PAM Cryptocard Module</h3>
<p>A PAM cryptocard module is available <a href="http://projects.jdimedia.nl/index.phtml?ID=crypto&amp;L=&amp;BROW=1&amp;W=1260&amp;H=886">http://projects.jdimedia.nl/index.phtml?ID=crypto&amp;L=&amp;BROW=1&amp;W=1260&amp;H=886</a>.
Cryptocards are excellent for securing interactive logins since
they do not require any special equipment on the client end, thus
you can log in from a cybercafe for example with no fear of your
password being stolen (since it changes each time you log in).
Unfortunately Cryptocards tend to be expensive and require some
user training, I would advise them primarily for installations
with a higher need of security then &quot;normal&quot; or for
infrastructure related servers and equipment (i.e. Authentication
servers). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pam Smart Card Module</h3>
<p>Smartcards can be used to sign and encrypt email as well as
providing login services. The primary problem with smartcards
however is that the client station needs a compatible card
reader, the chances of finding these on a system outside of your
office are slim indeed. A module to provide PAM support for
smartcards is available <a href="http://www.linuxnet.com/apps.html">http://www.linuxnet.com/apps.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pam module for SMB</h3>
<p>SMB (Server Message Block) is incredibly popular protocol for
the simple reason Microsoft has choosen to use it as their
primary protocol for Windows 9x and NT (it is also supported in
2000). Many sites have existing NT infrastructures, adding Linux
servers that require their own authentications infrastructure can
be quite troublesome. Fortunately you can authenticate on Linux
machines against SMB servers, packages are available <a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=pam_smb">http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=pam_smb</a>
and the primary site is <a href="http://www.csn.ul.ie/~airlied/pam_smb/">http://www.csn.ul.ie/~airlied/pam_smb/</a>.
You can also install SAMBA on the machine and use this to
authenticate but for workstations the PAM module is much more
appropriate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Authentication services</h2>
<p>Authentication services such as NIS and Kerberos are covered
in the network servers section of the LASG <a href="../network-servers/authentication/">here</a>. Generally
speaking they are easy to implement client side on modern Linux
distributions, during install you are often given the choice of
Kerberos, LDAP or NIS+ passwords and their related settings.
Setting up the servers however is another matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Passwords&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In all UNIX-like operating systems there are several
constants, and one of them is the file /etc/passwd and how it
works. For user authentication to work properly you need
(minimally) some sort of file(s) with UID to username mappings,
GID to groupname mappings, passwords for the users, and other
misc. info. The problem with this is that everyone needs access
to the passwd file, every time you do an ls it gets checked, so
how do you store all those passwords safely, yet keep them world
readable? For many years the solution has been quite simple and
effective, simply hash the passwords, and store the hash, when a
user needs to authenticate take the password they enter it, hash
it, and if it matches then it was obviously the same password.
The problem with this is that computing power has grown
enormously and I can now take a copy of your passwd file, and try
to brute force it open in a reasonable amount of time (assuming
you use a poor hash system, or weak passwords). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use a better hash</h3>
<p>Using a hash such as MD5 or blowfish significantly increases
the amount of computing power needed to execute a brute force
attack, but there are two large problems with switching from the
traditional crypt hash. The first is compatibility, if you use
NIS or NIS+ with systems such as Solaris using a different hash
then crypt will break authentication, obviously a problem. The
other problem is that no matter how strong a hash you use poor
passwords (such as the username or &quot;dog&quot;) will still be
easily discovered. If possible you should use a better hash, but
if this is not possible then there is another solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use shadow passwords</h3>
<p>User account data is stored in /etc/passwd traditionally, but
the actual password hashes and related data (password expiry,
etc.) is stored in /etc/shadow, a file only readable by root.
Programs that need to check a password can either run as root or
use a setuid or setgid wrapper program (like PAM provides) to
check the password, the only way to get access to /etc/shadow
requires root privileges. There have been problems in past with
setuid programs that read /etc/shadow leaking information,
however these are relatively rare (and you are no worse off then
storing passwords in a world readable location). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several OS's take the first solution, Linux has implemented
the second for quite a while now. Because most vendors rely on
PAM for authentication services, implementing a new
authentication scheme is relatively simple, all you need to do it
add a PAM module that understands the new authentication scheme
and edit the PAM config file for whichever program (say login)
uses it. Now for an attacker to look at the hashed passwords they
must go to quite a bit more effort then simply copying the
/etc/passwd file. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cracking passwords</h2>
<p>In Linux the passwords are stored in a hashed format, however
this does not make them irretrievable, chances are you cannot
reverse engineer the password from the resulting hash, however
you can hash a list of words and compare them. If the results
match then you have found the password (the chances of a
different word hashing to the same value as another are slim),
this is why good passwords are critical, and dictionary based
words are a terrible idea. Even with a shadow passwords file the
passwords are still accessible by the root user, and if you have
improperly written scripts or programs that run as root (say a
www based CGI script) the password file may be retrieved by
attackers. The majority of current password cracking software
also allows running on multiple hosts in parallel to speed things
up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most modern Linux distributions use MD5 hashed passwords at a
minimum (notable exceptions are SuSE and Debian which default to
crypt for backwards compatibility with NIS and the like). In any
event password crackers will usually catch poor passwords or
dictionary based passwords quickly. As well on modern systems
passwords are protected in shadow password files, if an attacker
has access to this file chances are they have sufficient
privilege to do other things to compromise the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VCU</h3>
<p>VCU (Velocity Cracking Utilities) is a windows based programs
to aid in cracking passwords, &#147;VCU attempts to make the
cracking of passwords a simple task for computer users of any
experience level.&#148;. You can download it <a href="http://packetstormsecurity.org/groups/wiltered_fire/NEW/vcu/">http://packetstormsecurity.org/groups/wiltered_fire/NEW/vcu/</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Password storage</h2>
<p>This is something many people don&#146;t think about much. How
can you securely store passwords? The most obvious method is to
memorize them, this however has it&#146;s drawbacks, if you
administer 30 different sites you generally want to have 30
different passwords, and a good password is 8+ characters in
length and generally not the easiest thing to remember. This
leads to many people using the same passwords on several systems
(come on, admit it). One of the easiest methods is to write
passwords down. This is usually a BIG NO-NO; you&#146;d be
surprised what people find lying around, and what they find if
they are looking for it. A better option is to store passwords in
an encrypted format, usually electronically on your computer or
palm pilot, this way you only have to remember one password to
unlock the rest which you can then use. Something as simple as
PGP or GnuPG can be used to accomplish this.&nbsp; If you can
afford it using authentication tokens or smartcards are a good
way to reduce the number of passwords you must memorize.</p>
<p>Many of these programs have been found to contain flaws, I
advise using them with caution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Strip</h3>
<p>Strip is a palm pilot program for storing passwords securely
and can also be used to generate passwords. It is GNU licensed
and available <a href="http://www.zetetic.net/products.html">http://www.zetetic.net/products.html</a>.&nbsp;
The generation function is flawed and should not be used.</p>
