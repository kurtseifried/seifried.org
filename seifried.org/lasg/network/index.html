<p>Network security is a pretty broad topic, so I've broken it
down into a couple of sections. In this area I cover the bottom 4
or so layers (transport, network, datalink, physical) of the 7
layer OSI protocol stack, the top 3 (application, presentation,
session) are in the network server section and so forth (roughly
speaking). I also cover some of the basic network configuration
files, since an explanation is always useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="physical-protocols.html">Physical protocols</a></h2>
<p>Physical protols such as PPP and Ethernet provide the
foundation for TCP-IP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>TCP-IP security</h2>
<p>TCP-IP was created in a time and place where security wasn't a
very strong concern. Initially the 'Internet' (then called
Arpanet) consisted of very few hosts, all were academic sites,
big corporations or government in nature. Everyone knew everyone
else, and getting on the Internet was a pretty big deal. The
TCP-IP suite of protocol is remarkably robust (it hasn't failed
horribly yet), but unfortunately it has no real provisions for
security (i.e. authentication, verification, encryption and so
on). Spoofing packets, intercepting packets, reading data
payloads, and so is remarkably easy in today's Internet. The most
common attacks are denial of service attacks since they are the
easiest to execute and the hardest to defeat, followed by packet
sniffing, port scanning, and other related activities.</p>
<p>Hostnames don't always point at the right IP addresses and IP
addresses don't always reverse lookup to the right hostname. Do
not use hostname-based authentication if possible. Because DNS
cache poisoning is relatively easy, relying on an IP address for
authentication reduces the problem to one of spoofing, which is
somewhat more secure but by no means truly secure. There are no
mechanisms in wide spread use to verify who sent data and who is
receiving it except by use of session or IP level encryption
(IPSec/IPv6 and other VPN technologies are starting to gain
momentum however).</p>
<p>You can start by denying inbound data that claims to originate
from your network(s), as this data is obviously spoofed. And to
prevent your users, or people who have broken into your network,
from launching spoofed attacks you should block all outbound data
that is not from your IP addresses. This is relatively simple and
easy to manage but the vast majority of networks do not do it (I
spent about a year pestering my ISP before they started). If
everyone on the Internet had egress filters (that is restricted
outbound traffic to that which is from their internal IP
addresses) spoofing attacks would be impossible, and thus tracing
attackers back to source would be far easier. You should also
block the reserved networks (127.*, 10.*, etc.). I have noticed
many attacks from the Internet with packets labeled as from those
IP ranges. if you use network address translation (like IPMASQ)
and do not have it properly firewalled you could be easily
attacked or used to relay an attack to a third party.</p>
<p>If you must communicate securely with people, consider using
VPN technology. The only available technology that has wide
acceptance and is slated to become a the standard (in IPv6) is
IPSec, it is an open standard supported by many vendors and most
major vendors have actual working implementations native to their
OS (although some are crippled to comply with US export laws).
Please see Appendix B or the Encrypting Services and Data section
for more details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IPSec</h3>
<p><a href="../vpn/index.html">IPSec is covered in it&#146;s own
section.</a> I think it is the future of VPN technology
(it&#146;s the most commonly supported standard as of today, and
an integral part of IPv6).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IPv6</h3>
<p>IPv6 provides no security per se, but it does have built in
hooks for future security enhancements, IPSec support and so on.
If used on a network it would of course make life more difficult
for an attacker as IPv6 use is not yet widespread. If you want to
learn more visit: <a href="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/">http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/</a>.
Linux currently supports IPv6 pretty much completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Attacking TCP-IP</h2>
<p>TCP-IP was not built with security in mind and consequently
suffers a wide variety of problems that can be exploited by
attackers. From hijacked connections to spoofing and sending
mangled packets, the limits are endless. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>HUNT Project</h3>
<p>The HUNT Project is a set of tools for manipulating TCP-IP
connections (typically on an Ethernet LAN), that is it can reset
connections, spy on them and do otherwise &#147;naughty&#148;
things. It also includes a variety of ARP based attacks and other
mischievous sources of fun, You can get HUNT at: <a href="http://lin.fsid.cvut.cz/~kra/index.html">http://lin.fsid.cvut.cz/~kra/index.html</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Basic config files and utilities</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>/etc/inetd.conf</h3>
<p>inetd.conf is responsible for starting services, typically
ones that do not need to run continuously, or are session based
(such as telnet, or ftpd). This is because the overhead of
running a service constantly (like telnet) would be higher then
the occasional start up cost (or firing in.telnetd up) when a
user wants to use it. For some services (like DNS) that service
many quick connections, the overhead of starting the service
every few seconds would be higher then constantly running it.
Also with services such as DNS and email time is critical, a few
seconds delay starting an ftp session won't hurt much. The man
page for inetd.conf covers the basics (&#147;man
inetd.conf&#148;). The service itself is called inetd and is run
at boot time, so you can easily stop/start/reload it by
manipulating the inetd process. Whenever you make changes to
inetd.conf you must restart inetd to make the changes effective,
killall -1 inetd will restart it properly. Lines in inetd.conf
can be commented out with a # as usual (this is a very simple and
effective way of disabling services like rexec). It is advisable
to disable as many services in inetd.conf as possible, typically
the only ones in use will be ftp, pop and imap. Telnet and r
services should be replaced with SSH and services like
systat/netstat and finger give away far to much information.
Access to programs started by inetd can be easily controlled by
the use of TCP_WRAPPERS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>/etc/services</h3>
<p>The services file is a list of port numbers, the protocol and
the corresponding name. The format is:</p>
<pre>service-name port/protocol aliases # optional comment</pre>
<p>for example:</p>
<pre>time 37/udp timserver
rlp 39/udp resource # resource location
name 42/udp nameserver
whois 43/tcp nicname # usually to sri-nic
domain 53/tcp
domain 53/udp</pre>
<p>This file is used for example when you run 'netstat -a', and
of course not used when you run 'netstat -an'</p>
<p>For a large services file please see <a href="http://seifried.org/security/ports/">http://seifried.org/security/ports/</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TCP_WRAPPERS</h3>
<p>Using TCP_WRAPPERS makes securing your servers against outside
intrusion is a lot simpler and painless then you would expect.
TCP_WRAPPERS is controlled from two files:</p>
<pre>/etc/hosts.allow
/etc/hosts.deny</pre>
<p>hosts.allow is checked first, and the rules are checked from
first to last. If it finds a rule that explicitly allows you in
(i.e., a rule allowing your host, domain, subnet mask, etc.) it
lets you connect to the service. If it fails to find any rules
that pertain to you in hosts.allow, it then goes to check
hosts.deny for a rule denying you entry. Again it checks the
rules in hosts.deny from first to last, and the first rule it
finds that denies you access (i.e., a rule disallowing your host,
domain, subnet mask, etc.) means it doesn't let you in. If it
fails to find a rule denying you entry it then by default lets
you. If you are paranoid like me the last rule (or only rule if
you are going to a default policy of non-optimistic security)
should be:<br>
in hosts.deny:</p>
<pre>ALL: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0</pre>
<p>which means all services, all locations, so any service not
explicitly allowed is then blocked (remember the default is to
allow). You might also want to just default deny access to say
telnet and leave ftp wide open to the world. To do this you would
have:</p>
<p>in hosts.allow:</p>
<pre>in.telnetd: 10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0 # allow access from my internal network of 10.0.0.*
in.ftpd: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 # allow access from anywhere in the world</pre>
<p>in hosts.deny:</p>
<pre>in.telnetd: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 # deny access to telnetd from anywhere</pre>
<p>or if you wish to be really safe:</p>
<pre>ALL: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 # deny access to everything from everywhere</pre>
<p>This may affect services such as ssh and nfs, so be
careful!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wish to simply list all the services you are using
separately:</p>
<pre>in.telnetd: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
ipop3d: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0</pre>
<p>If you leave a service on that you shouldn't have in
inetd.conf, and DO NOT have a default deny policy, you could be
up the creek. It is safer (and a bit more work, but in the long
run less work then rebuilding the server) to have default deny
rules for firewalling and TCP_WRAPPERS, thus is you leave
something on by accident, by default there will be no access to
it. If you install something that users need access and you
forget to put allow rules in, they will quickly complain that
they can't get access and you will be able to rectify the problem
quickly. Erring on the side of caution and accidentally denying
something is a lot safer then leaving it open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man pages for TCP_WRAPPERS are very good and available by:</p>
<pre>man hosts.allow
man hosts_allow</pre>
<p>and/or (they are the same man page):</p>
<pre>man hosts.deny
man hosts_deny</pre>
<p>One minor caveat with TCP_WRAPPERS that recently popped up on
Bugtraq, TCP_WRAPPERS interprets lines in hosts.allow and
hosts.deny in the following manner:</p>
<p>1) strip off all \'s (line continuations), making all the
lines complete (also note the max length of a line is about 2k,
better to use multiple lines in some cases).</p>
<p>2) strip out lines starting with #'s, i.e. all commented out
lines. Thus:</p>
<pre># this is a test
# in.ftpd: 1.1.1.1 \
in.telnetd: 1.1.1.1</pre>
<p>this means the &quot;in.telnetd: 1.1.1.1&quot; line would be
ignored as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is running and who is it talking to?</h2>
<p>You can&#146;t start securing services until you know what is
running. For this task ps and netstat are invaluable; ps will
tell you what is currently running (httpd, inetd, etc) and
netstat will tell you what the status of ports are (at this point
we&#146;re interested in ports that are open and listening, that
is waiting for connections). We can take a look at the various
config files that control network services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>ps </h3>
<p>The program ps shows us process status (information available
in the /proc virtual filesystem). The options most commonly used
are &#147;ps -xau&#148;, which show pretty much all the
information you&#146;d ever want to know. Please note: these
options vary across UNIX systems, Solaris, SCO, etc all behave
differently (which is incredibly annoying). The following is
typical output from a machine (using &#147;ps &#150;xau&#148;).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The interesting ones are: portmap, named, Squid (and it&#146;s
dnsserver, unlinkd and ftpget children processes), httpd,
syslogd, sshd, rpc.mountd, rpc.nfsd, dhcpd, inetd, and sendmail
(this server appears to be providing gateway services, email and
NFS file sharing). The easiest way to learn how to read ps output
is go over the ps man page and learn what the various fields are
(most are self explanatory, such as %CPU, while some like SIZE
are a bit obscure: SIZE is the number of 4k memory
&#145;pages&#146; a program is using). To figure out what the
running programs are a safe bet is &#145;man
&lt;command_name&gt;&#146;; which almost always gives you the
manual page pertaining to that service (such as httpd). You will
notice that services like telnet, ftpd, identd and several others
do not show up even though they are on. This is because they are
run from inetd, the &#145;superserver&#146;. To find these
services look at /etc/inetd.conf or your &#147;netstat
&#150;vat&#148; output.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>netstat </h3>
<p>netstat tells us pretty much anything network-related that you
can imagine. It is especially good at listing active connections
and sockets. Using netstat we can find which ports on which
interfaces are active. The following output is from a typical
server using netstat &#150;vat.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Numeric output is in my opinion easier to read (once you
memorize /etc/services). The interesting fields for us are the
first field, type of service, the fourth field which is the IP
address of the interface and the port, the foreign address (if
not 0.0.0.0.* means someone is actively talking to it), and the
port state. The first line is a remote client talking to the web
server on this machine (port 80). We then see the www server
listening on 0.0.0.0:80 which means all interfaces, port 80,
followed by the DNS server running on all 3 interfaces, a samba
server (139), a mail server (25), an NFS server (2049) and so on.
You will notice the ftp server (21) listed, even though it is run
out of inetd, and not currently in use (i.e. no one is actively
ftping in), it is listed in the netstat output. This makes
netstat especially useful for finding out what is active on a
machine, making an inventory of active and inactive network
related software on the server much easier. ****** netstat -p
option now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>lsof</h3>
<p>lsof is a handy program similar in idea to ps, except that it
prints out what files/etc are open, which can include network
sockets. Unfortunately your average lsof puts out a lot of
information, so you will need to use grep or redirect it through
less (&#147;lsof | less&#148;) to make it easier to read.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This example shows that we have Squid running, listening on
ports 3128 and 3130, the last two lines show an open connection
from an internal host to the Squid server and the resulting
action Squid has taken to fulfill the request (going to
www.example.org). host1 is the Squid server and host2 is the
client machine making the request. This is an invaluable tool for
getting a precise image of what is going on network wise with
your server. You can get lsof with some distributions. Please
note that versions of lsof compiled for kernel version 2.0.x will
not work with kernel 2.2.x and vice versa, as there were too many
changes. The primary site for lsof is at: <a href="ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/">ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/</a>.</p>

<h2>Routing security</h2>
<p>There are a variety of routing software packages available for
Linux. Most of them support the newer routing protocols which
have a much higher degree of security then the older protocols
such as RIP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>routed</h3>
<p>routed is one of the standard routing packages available for
Linux. It supports RIP (about the oldest routing protocol still
in service), and that&#146;s it. RIP is very simple, routers
simply broadcast their routing tables to neighboring routers,
resulting (in theory) in a complete routing table that contains
entries for every destination on the Internet. This method is
fundamentally insecure, and very inefficient outside of small
secure networks (in which case it probably is not needed).
Securing it is really not possible, you can firewall ports 520
and 521 which RIP uses to transfer data, however this can result
in routes you want not getting through, and attackers can still
spoof routes. Running this service is a very bad idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>gated</h3>
<p>gated is a more advanced piece of routing software then
routed. It supports RIP versions 1 and 2, DCN HELLO, OSPF version
2, EGP version 2, and BGP versions 2 through 4. Currently the
most popular routing protocol seems to be BGP (Border Gateway
Protocol), with OSPF gaining popularity (OSPF has built in
security, is very efficient, and quite a bit more
complicated).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MRT</h3>
<p>MRT (Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit) is a routing daemon and
test toolkit that can handle IPv4 and IPv6. You can get it at: <a href="http://www.mrtd.net/">http://www.mrtd.net/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>zebra</h3>
<p>zebra is much more featured then gated, and sports a nice
Cisco style command line interface. It runs as a daemon, and is
multi threaded for performance, each protocol (RIP, OSPF, etc.)
has it&#146;s own configuration, and you can run multiple
protocols simultaneously (although this could lead to
confusion/problems). There is a master configuration port, and a
port for each protocol:</p>
<pre>zebrasrv	2600/tcp		# zebra service
zebra		2601/tcp		# zebra vty
ripd		2602/tcp		# RIPd vty
ripngd		2603/tcp		# RIPngd vty
ospfd		2604/tcp		# OSPFd vty
bgpd		2605/tcp		# BGPd vty
ospf6d		2606/tcp		# OSPF6d vty</pre>
<p>I would advise firewalling these ports. Access is controlled
by a login password, and access to command functions requires
another password (using the same syntax as Cisco,
&#147;enable&#148;). You can download zebra from: <a href="http://www.zebra.org/">http://www.zebra.org/</a>.</p>
