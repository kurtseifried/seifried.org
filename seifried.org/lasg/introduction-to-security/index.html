<h2>What is computer security?</h2>
<p>Security is risk management. - unknown</p>
<p>&quot;A computer is secure if you can depend on it and it's
software to behave as you expect&quot; - Practical UNIX and
Internet Security</p>
<p>Security is: availability, consistency, access control, data
confidentiality, authentication. - <a href="http://www.sun.com/security/overview.html">http://www.sun.com/security/overview.html</a>
</p>
<p>&quot;The principal objective of computer security is to
protect and assure the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of automated information systems and the data they
contain.&quot; - <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/secpubs/cslaw.txt">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/secpubs/cslaw.txt</a>
</p>
<p>There are numerous definitions for &quot;computer
security&quot;, and most of them are correct. Essentially
computer security means enforcement of usage policies, this must
be done since people and software have flaws that can result in
accidents, but also because someone may want to steal your
information, use your resources inappropriately or simply deny
you the use of your resources. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Security Policy</h2>
<p>A security policy is an expression of your organizations
security goals. Security goals will vary greatly by organization,
for example a software vendor is typically more concerned about
the confidentiality and integrity of their source code anything
else, while a pornographic website is probably more concerned
about processing credit cards online. There is an immense amount
of security technology available, from software and hardware to
specific techniques and implementations. You cannot properly
implement the technology without a solid idea of what your goals
are. Do home users connecting to the office need to use VPN
software? If your security policy states that all file and print
transfers must either be encrypted or sent across a
&quot;trusted&quot; network then the answer is probably yes. What
authentication methods are acceptable for services that can be
reached from the Internet? Do you require strong passwords,
tokens, biometric authentication, or some combination? The data
you collect from remote sites, is it more important that this
data is collected, or is it more important that this data remain
secret? Data that is remote weather telemetry is probably not as
sensitive as credit card numbers. </p>
<p>Some security policies will need to be exceptionally broad and
general, for example the security policy for JANET, the academic
backbone network for England states:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>Monitoring and Enforcement </h5>
<p>19. It follows from the policy of cascaded responsibility
backed up by written site agreements, that there must be some
method for UKERNA to enforce the possible disconnection
envisaged by the AUP, and to provide full access and
assistance to law enforcement agencies where necessary. </p>
<p>20. The JANET-CERT has therefore been given the
responsibility (in conjunction with UKERNA) to </p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor use of the network, as far as is possible
while respecting privacy, either in response to
information about a specific threat, or generally
because of a perceived situation </li>
<li>Require a primary site, through its nominated
contact, to rectify any omission in its duty of
responsibility </li>
<li>Where a site is unable or unwilling to co-operate,
report the issue to UKERNA and initiate the procedure
for achieving an emergency disconnection </li>
<li>Obtain evidence and pass on information as necessary
in order to assist an investigation by a law
enforcement agency </li>
<li>Provide support and co-ordination for investigations
into breaches of security </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand a security policiy can be fine grained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All internal email must be encrypted with PGP or GnuPG
using a key of at least 1024 bits that is signed by an
authorized signing entity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking the more detailed and technology oriented a
security policy is the harder it will be to follow and keep up to
date. The actuall technical details of implementing a security
policy should be seperated from it. Keeping a seperate set of
best practices or an actually &quot;implementation of security
policy&quot; document is a better idea then rolling it all into
the security policy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
<p>Another component of computer security is an AUP (Acceptable
Use Policy). This is a document that sates what a user of your
resources may or may not do with them. Typically it is part of a
contract and is signed at the time when the services are
purchased. Many acceptable use policies generally forbid actions
that are illegal, potentially annoying to other people (and hence
likely to cause problems for the provider inthe form of
complaints) or are controversial (such as pornography). Other
standard clauses include &quot;this notice may change at any time
without warning&quot; and &quot;we can terminate your service (or
fire you) at any time without warning if you violate this policy.
Generally speaking the majority of AUP's are reasonable and will
not be a problem for normal users. These are a good compliment to
a security policy as they set out in concret terms what a user is
or is not allowed to do, and as they are often part of a contract
it allows a provider to enforce their security policy when a user
attempts to violate it or has violated it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Privacy policies are interesting in that they are supposed to
prevent an organization 9typically a company) from violating some
aspects of a user's security (specifically the confidentiality of
their information). Unfortunately the majority of privacy
policies contain clauses like &quot;this policy may change at any
time without warning&quot; or are simply discarded when a company
decides to profit off of a user's information (such as name,
address, credit card details, purchase history, etc.). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Security is a process </h2>
<p>You only need to make one mistake or leave one flaw available
for an attacker to get in. This of course means that most sites
will eventually be broken into. Witness the effects of Code Red,
an Nimda, both of which were hugely succesful exploiting well
known and long solved vulnerabilities in the Microsoft IIS
server. Regularily apply patches (after testing them). Regularly
scan your network for open ports. Regularly scan your servers
with intrusion testing software such as Nessus. Audit file
permissions and make sure there are no unexpected setuid or
setgid binaries. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Defense in depth</h2>
<p>All technical security measures will eventually fail or be
vulnerable to an attacker. This is why you must have multiple
layers of protection. Firewalls are not enough, you may
accidently forget a rule or leave yourself exposed while
reinitializing a ruleset, use tcp_wrappers to restrict access to
services as well where possible. Restrict which users can access
these services, especially if only a few users need access.
Encrypt traffic where possible so that attackers cannot easily
snoop usernames and passwords or hijack sessions. Since security
measures will fail you also need a strong audit and logging
process so that you can later find out what went wrong and how
bad it is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Technical problems</h2>
<p>These are just a handful of thousands of specific technical
problems facing security administrators. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Network Connectivity</h3>
<p>One of the biggest security challenges is the increase in
network connectivity. If you have a machine that is not connected
to any other machines an attacker will generally need to gain
physical access. This of course greatly narrows down the number
of attackers. However with everything connected to the Internet
there are over 100 million people that can potentially get into
your machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Insecure defaults</h3>
<p>This is one of the problems that has caused no end of security
problems since day one. Vendors typically ship their operating
systems with insecure defaults (i.e. finger, telnet, ftp, etc.)
meaning that administrators must expend a lot of effort to close
security problems before they can even start to pro-actively
secure their systems and networks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Legitimate access vs.s a break in</h3>
<p>Because you must grant legitimate users access to resources
there is always the potential for attackers to gain access.
Attacker can guess authentication credentials (i.e. weak
passwords), steal them (password sniffing), exploit flaws in the
server itself and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Minimizing access and privilege</h3>
<p>When possible restrict access. If you do not need to run
fingerd turn it off and remove it. An attacker cannot exploit
fingerd if it isn't present. Keep users off of servers if
possible, if they need shell accounts for some reason setup a
separate system and partition it off from the rest of your
network. Lock down workstations where possible, set BIOS
passwords, secure the boot sequence, do not give them
administrative access.</p>
