<p>Firewalling is the practice of filtering network traffic,
typically at the point where your network connects to another
(e.g. the Internet, a customers LAN, etc.) network, that may be
untrusted (in the case of the Internet) or perhaps even trusted
(another floor of your building). Like firewalls in a large
building, a network firewall can prevent and even block the
spread of an attack if one segment is compromised successfully,
like their namesake firewalls can stop your network from being
further compromised.&nbsp;There is a good FAQ on Internet
firewalls at: <a href="http://www.interhack.net/pubs/fwfaq/">http://www.interhack.net/pubs/fwfaq/</a>.
A list of port numbers and what they are is available <a href="http://seifried.org/security/ports/">here at seifried.org</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Firewall software for Linux</h2>
<p>Linux has gone through a series of firewalls. The most recent
is IPTables (sometimes referred to as NETFILTER), preceding that
was ipchains, and preceding this was ipfwadm, as well there are a
number of other firewalls such as IPF and SINUS firewall (some of
which only work on 2.0 and 2.2 series kernels so are largely
obsolete). I would recommend using a 2.4 kernel with IPTables if
possible since it offers stateful packet inspection, which makes
firewalling protocols such as DNS and FTP properly a lot easier.
Linux also supports IPMASQ (IP Masquerading) as part of it's
firewall capabilities, an advanced form of NAT (Network Address
Translation). IPMASQ allows you to hook up a network of computers
to the Internet but proxy their connections at the IP level. Thus
all traffic appears to be coming and going to one machine (the
Linux IPMASQ box) which affords a high degree of protection to
the internal network. As an added bonus the clients on the
internal network require NO proxy configuration; as long as the
Linux IPMASQ server is configured correctly, and the clients use
it as their default gateway, things will work quite well.</p>
<p>Both ipchains and ipfwadm provide the following basic
capabilities:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>blocking/passing of data based on source/destination IP
address and port</li>
<li>masquerading of connections based on source/destination
IP address and port</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to which ipchains supports:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>port forwarding</li>
<li>creation of chains, for more intricate rules and
conditions, speedier rule parsing and easier management</li>
<li>quality of service (QOS) routing, useful on low speed
connections or otherwise saturated connections</li>
<li>specification of IP/port/interface as well as inverse
specification (using the !, i.e. &quot;everything
but&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Firewall-HOWTO and &quot;man &lt;command&gt;&quot;
(ipchains, ipfwadm or IPTables) page both cover in great detail
the mechanics for setting up rules, but don't really cover the
strategy for firewalling safely. Your first basic choice (well
actually it's not so basic) to make is whether to go with default
deny or default allow policies, followed by which services and
hosts you wish to allow and block.</p>
<p>When deciding policy you should ideally choose a policy that
will default to denying everything unless specifically allowed
through (that is if there is a failure it will hopefully be
minimized via default policies) or a policy that allows
everything and blocks certain services/hosts. I typically use a
policy of default denial as it can accommodate mistakes and
changes more safely then a policy that defaults to allowing data
through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case in point, you have a server secured via firewalling,
currently running Apache, you install WU-FTPD on it for internal
use (so people can upload files) at 3 am, you forget to change
the firewall rules. If you have chosen a policy of default
allowal, anyone on the Internet can access the ftp server, and
silly you, you installed an old version which allowed someone to
compromise the machine. If on the other hand you go with a policy
of default denial, they would not have access to the ftp server,
and neither would your users, but you would find out quite
quickly. Annoyed users are much easier to appease then fixing a
network that has been compromised.</p>

<h2><a href="firewalling-concepts.html">Firewall concepts</a></h2>
<p>Some of the problems with firewalling and what you can do
ensure they don't affect you to much. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="iptables.html">IPTables</a></h2>
<p>Firewalling for Linux 2.4 and 2.5. Provides stateful filtering
unlike IPChains and IPFWADM. Combined with Linux advanced routing
you can do many interesting and several downright bizarre things.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="ipchains.html">IPChains</a></h2>
<p>Firewalling for Linux 2.2 and present in 2.4 for backwards
compatibility as well. Does not provide stateful filtering, but
provides chains, making it easier to manage then ipfwadm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="ipfwadm.html">IPFWADM</a></h2>
<p>Firewalling for Linux 2.0, no longer present. Not recommended.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Firewall piercing</h2>
<p>Sometimes you will be stuck behind a firewall that is not
properly set up, or otherwise stopping you from accessing data
you need to. Other times users will simply want to climb over any
walls you put on the network, and the best way to defend is to
understand the attack. There is actually a mini-HOWTO on this; <a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Firewall-Piercing.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Firewall-Piercing.html</a>.
In addition to this is an add-on for the IP Masquerading code
that allows certain types of VPN's through, you can get it at: <a href="ftp://ftp.rubyriver.com/pub/jhardin/masquerade/ip_masq_vpn.html">ftp://ftp.rubyriver.com/pub/jhardin/masquerade/ip_masq_vpn.html</a>.
