<p>Over the last few years the number of security tools for
Windows and UNIX has risen dramatically, even more surprising is
the fact that most of them are freely available on the Internet.
I will only cover the free tools since they tend to be the best
(i.e. nmap, Nessus, etc.) and any serious cracker will have these
tools at their disposal, why shouldn't you? There are several
main categories of tools; ones that scan hosts from within that
host, ones that scan other hosts and report back variously what
OS they are running, services that are available and so on (i.e.
TCP level scanners), and at the top of the food chain are the
intrusion tools (i.e. application level scanners) that can
actually execute exploits, and report back whether they worked or
not, and lastly I include the exploits category, while not
strictly an intrusion tool per se they do exist and you should be
aware of them.&nbsp; These tools and techniques can also be used
to conduct a self audit and ensure that the systems react as you
think they should (i.e. you should be able to run the denial of
service attacks that Nessus is capable of with no ill effects on
your servers). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Host scanners</h2>
<p>Host scanners are software packages you run locally on the
system to probe for problems.&nbsp;Most of them are
&quot;dead&quot; now because vendors have become much more
security conscious and started to move away from some of the
insanely insecure defaults that used to be common. As well with
the increase of networking (i.e. virtually every system is now
attached to the Internet full-time or at least part-time) the
focus has shifted from host security (i.e. people with accounts)
to network security (which means anyone of 100+ million people
can potentially access it). For information on finding and
removing setuid bits and tightening file permissions please see
the <a href="../filesystem/">filesystem section</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Network scanners">Network scanners</a></h2>
<p>Network scanners typically operate at the network level
(imagine that), using protocols like TCP-IP, UDP, ICMP to elicit
a response that will (among other things) tell them if a server
is listening on the port, if it is firewalled, what the OS in use
is and so forth. If you can find open ports and services then
chances are an attacker can too. The popularity of these network
scanners is apparent if you run a firewall, often within an hour
(or much less) you will be scanned, often aggressively. These
tools are also quite useful for finding out how a network is
secured, firewall and other restriction software such as
tcp_wrappers tend to respond differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nmap</h3>
<p>Nmap is a newer and much more fully-featured host scanning
tool. It features advanced techniques such as TCP-IP
fingerprinting, a method by which the returned TCP-IP packets are
examined and the host OS is deduced based on various quirks
present in all TCP-IP stacks. Nmap also supports a number of
scanning methods from normal TCP scans (simply trying to open a
connection as normal) to stealth scanning and half-open SYN scans
(great for crashing unstable TCP-IP stacks). This is arguably one
of the best port scanning programs available, commercial or
otherwise. Nmap is available <a href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/index.html">http://www.insecure.org/nmap/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Firewalk</h3>
<p>Firewalk is a program that uses a traceroute style of packets
to scan a firewall and attempt to deduce the rules in place on
that firewall. By sending out packets with various time to lives
and seeing where they die or are refused a firewall can be
tricked into revealing rules. There is no real defense against
this apart from silently denying packets instead of sending a
rejection message which hopefully will reveal less. I would
advise utilizing this tool against your systems as the results
can help you tighten up security. Firewalk is available <a href="http://www.packetfactory.net/firewalk/">http://www.packetfactory.net/firewalk/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>ICMP related scanning</h3>
<p>There is an excellent paper entitled &quot;ICMP Usage In
Scanning&quot; by Ofir Arkin available <a href="http://www.sys-security.com/html/papers.html">http://www.sys-security.com/html/papers.html</a>.
It covers topics from detecting ACL's using ICMP to specific
hardware and operating system issues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>spidermap</h3>
<p>spidermap is a set of perl scripts to help automate scans and
make them more selective. You can get it <a href="http://www.digitaloffense.net/spidermap/">http://www.digitaloffense.net/spidermap/</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Application level Scanners">Application level
Scanners</a></h2>
<p>Application level scanners are one evolutionary step up from
network scanners (although they often incorporate network
scanning). These software packages will actually identify
vulnerabilities, and in some cases allow you to actively try and
exploit them. If your machines are susceptible to these attacks,
you need to start fixing things, as any attacker can get these
programs and use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nessus</h3>
<p>Nessus is relatively new but is fast shaping up to be one of
the best intrusion scanning tools. It has a client/server
architecture, the server currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD
and Solaris, clients are available for Linux, Windows and there
is a Java client. Communication between the server and client is
ciphered for added security all in all a very slick piece of
code. Nessus supports port scanning, and attacking, based on IP
addresses or host name(s). It can also search through network DNS
information and attack related hosts at your bequest. Nessus is
relatively slow in attack mode, which is hardly surprising.
However it currently has over 200 attacks and a plug-in language
so you can write your own. Nessus is available from <a href="http://www.nessus.org/">http://www.nessus.org/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Saint</h3>
<p>Saint is the sequel to Satan, a network security scanner made
(in)famous by the media a few years ago (there were great worries
that bad people would take over the Internet using it). Saint
also uses a client/server architecture, but uses a www interface
instead of a client program. Saint produces very easy to read and
understand output, with security problems graded by priority
(although not always correctly) and also supports add-in scanning
modules making it very flexible. Saint is available from: <a href="http://www.wwdsi.com/products/saint_engine.html">http://www.wwdsi.com/products/saint_engine.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ftpcheck / Relaycheck</h3>
<p>Two simple utilities that scan for ftp servers and mail
servers that allow relaying, good for keeping tabs on naughty
users installing services they shouldn&#146;t (or simply
misconfiguring them), available from: <a href="http://david.weekly.org/code/">http://david.weekly.org/code/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SARA</h3>
<p>Security Auditor&#146;s Research Assistant (SARA) is a tool
similar in function to SATAN and Saint. SARA supports multiple
threads for faster scans, stores it&#146;s data in a database for
ease of access and generates nice HTML reports. SARA is free for
use and is available from: <a href="http://www-arc.com/sara/">http://www-arc.com/sara/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>BASS</h3>
<p>BASS is the &#147;Bulk Auditing Security Scanner&#148; allows
you to scan the internet for a variety of well known exploits. It
was basically a proof of concept that the Internet is not secure.
You can get it from: <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/data/tools/network/bass-1.0.7.tar.gz">http://www.securityfocus.com/data/tools/network/bass-1.0.7.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Exploits">Exploits</a></h2>
<p>I won't cover exploits specifically, since there are hundreds
if not thousands of them floating around for Linux. Probably the
best site to visit for exploits is Packetstorm (which is about
the only major public exploit archive available now), available <a href="http://www.packetstormsecurity.net/">http://www.packetstormsecurity.net/</a>.
