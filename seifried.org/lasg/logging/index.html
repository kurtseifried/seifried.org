<p>One integral part of any UNIX system are the logging
facilities. The majority of logging in Linux is provided by two
main programs, sysklogd and klogd, the first providing logging
services to programs and applications, the second providing
logging capability to the Linux kernel. Klogd actually sends most
messages to the syslogd facility but will on occasion pop up
messages at the console (i.e. kernel panics). Sysklogd actually
handles the task of processing most messages and sending them to
the appropriate file or device, this is configured from within
/etc/syslog.conf. By default most logging to files takes place in
/var/log/, and generally speaking programs that handle their own
logging (most httpd servers handle their logging internally) log
to /var/log/program-name/, which allows you to centralize the log
files and makes it easier to place them on a separate partition
(some attacks can fill your logs quite quickly, and a full /
partition is no fun). Additionally there are programs that handle
their own interval logging, one of the more interesting being the
bash command shell. By default bash keeps a history file of
commands executed in ~username/.bash_history, this file can make
for extremely interesting reading, as oftentimes many admins will
accidentally type their passwords in at the command line. Apache
handles all of its logging internally, configurable from
httpd.conf and extremely flexible with the release of Apache
1.3.6 (it supports conditional logging). Sendmail handles its
logging requirements via syslogd but also has the option (via the
command line -X switch) of logging all SMTP transactions straight
to a file. This is highly inadvisable as the file will grow
enormous in a short span of time, but is useful for debugging.
See the sections in network security on Apache and Sendmail for
more information.</p>

<h2><a name="General log security">General log security</a></h2>
<p>Generally speaking you do not want to allow users to see the
log files of a server, and you especially don&#146;t want them to
be able to modify or delete them. Generally speaking most log
files are owned by the root user and group, and have no
permissions assigned for other, so in most cases the only user
able to modify the logs will be the root user (and if someone
cracks the root account all bets are off). There are a few extra
security precautions you can take however, the simplest being to
use the &#147;chattr&#148; (CHange ATTTRibutes command) to set
the log files to append only. This way in the event of a problem
like a /tmp race that allows people to overwrite files on the
system they cannot significantly damage the log files. To set a
file to append only use:&nbsp;</p>
<pre>chattr +a filename&nbsp;</pre>
<p>only the superuser has access to this function of chattr. If
you set all your log files to append only you must remember that
log rotation programs will fail as they will not be able to zero
the log file. Add a line to the script to unset the append only
attribute:</p>
<pre>chattr -a filename</pre>
<p>and add a line after the log rotation script to reset the
append only flag. If you keep log files on the system you may
also wish to set them immutable so they cannot be tampered with
as easily, to set the file immutable simply:</p>
<pre>chattr +i filename</pre>
<p>and this will prevent any changes (due to /tmp races, etc.) to
the file unless the attacker has root access (in which case
you&#146;re already in a world of hurt).&nbsp;</p>
<pre>chattr -i filename</pre>
<p>only the root user has access to the immutable flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="System logging">System logging</a></h2>
<p>One feature of Linux (and most unices) is the syslog and klog
facilities which allow software to generate log messages that are
then passed to alog daemon and handled (written to a local file,
a remote server, given to aprogram, and so on).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>sysklogd / klogd</h3>
<p>In a nutshell klogd handles kernel messages, depending on your
setup this can range from almost none to a great deal if for
example you turn on process accounting. It then passes most
messages to syslogd for actual handling (that is it places the
data in a physical file). The man pages for sysklogd, klogd and
syslog.conf are pretty good with clear examples. One exceedingly
powerful and often overlooked ability of syslog is to log
messages to a remote host running syslog. Since you can define
multiple locations for syslog messages (i.e. send all kern
messages to the /var/log/messages file, and to console, and to a
remote host or multiple remote hosts) this allows you to
centralize logging to a single host and easily check log files
for security violations and other strangeness. There are several
problems with syslogd and klogd however, the primary ones being
the ease of which once an attacker has gained root access to
deleting/modifying log files, there is no authentication built
into the standard logging facilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standard log files that are usually defined in syslog.conf
are:</p>
<pre>/var/log/messages
/var/log/secure
/var/log/maillog
/var/log/spooler</pre>
<p>The first one (messages) gets the majority of information
typically; user logins, TCP_WRAPPERS dumps information here, IP
firewall packet logging typically dumps information here and so
on. The second typically records entries for events like users
changing their UID/GID (via su, sudo, etc.), failed attempts when
passwords are required and so on. The maillog file typically
holds entries for every pop/imap connection (user login and
logout), and the header of each piece of email that goes in or
out of the system (from whom, to where, msgid, status, and so
on). The spooler file is not often used anymore as the number of
people running usenet or uucp has plummeted, uucp has been
basically replaced with ftp and email, and most usenet servers
are typically extremely powerful machines to handle a full, or
even partial newsfeed, meaning there aren't many of them
(typically one per ISP or more depending on size). Most home
users and small/medium sized business will not (and should not in
my opinion) run a usenet server, the amount of bandwidth and
machine power required is phenomenal, let alone the security
risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also define additional log files, for example you
could add:</p>
<pre>kern.* /var/log/kernel-log</pre>
<p>And you can selectively log to a separate log host:</p>
<pre>*.emerg @syslog-host
mail.* @mail-log-host</pre>
<p>Which would result in all kernel messages being logged to
/var/log/kernel-log, this is useful on headless servers since by
default kernel messages go to /dev/console (i.e. someone logged
in at the machines). In the second case all emergency messages
would be logged to the host &#147;syslog-host&#148;, and all the
mail log files would be sent to the &#147;mail-log-host&#148;
server, allowing you to easily maintain centralized log files of
various services. The default syslogd that ships with most Linux
distributions is horribly insecure, log files are easily tampered
with (or outright destroyed), and logging across the network is
completely insecure as well as dangerous for the servers
involved. I do not advise using syslog if you actually have a
need for reliable logging (i.e. the ability to later view log
files in the event of a break-in).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default file permissions on the log files are usually read
/ write for root, and nothing for anyone else. In addition to
this you can (and should) set the files append only (remember to
take logrotate into account though, it needs to zero the files).
This will prevent any deletion / modifications to the log files
unless root unsets the append only attribute first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>modular syslog</h3>
<p>changed</p>
<p><a href="http://www.core-sdi.com/download/download1_modular.html">http://www.core-sdi.com/download/download1_modular.html</a>
</p>
<p>The major problem with syslog however is that tampering with
log files is trivial (setting the log files append only with
&#147;chattr +a&#148; helps, but if an attacker gains root, they
can unset the attribute). There is however a secure version of
syslogd, available at <a href="http://www.core-sdi.com/download/download1_modular.html">http://www.core-sdi.com/download/download1_modular.html</a>
(these guys generally make good tools and have a good reputation,
in any case it is open source software for those of you who are
truly paranoid). This allows you to cryptographically sign logs
to ensure they haven&#146;t been tampered with. Ultimately,
however, an attacker can still delete the log files so it is a
good idea to send them to another host, especially in the case of
a firewall to prevent the hard drive being filled up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>next generation syslog</h3>
<p>Another alternative is &#147;syslog-ng&#148; (Next Generation
Syslog), which seems much more customizable then either syslog or
secure-syslog, it supports digital signatures to prevent log
tampering, and can filter based on content of the message, not
just the facility it comes from or priority (something that is
very useful for cutting down on volume). Syslog-ng is available
at: <a href="http://www.balabit.hu/products/syslog-ng/">http://www.balabit.hu/products/syslog-ng/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nsyslogd</h3>
<p>Nsyslogd supports tcp, and SSL for logging to remote systems.
It runs on a variety of UNIX platforms and you can download it
from: <a href="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/nsyslog.html">http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/nsyslog.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Log monitoring">Log monitoring</a></h2>
<p>Log files are not much good unless you actually check them
once in a while, this is an almost impossible task for most of us
however due to the sheer volume of log files. There are a variety
of tools to automate these tasks however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Psionic Logcheck</h3>
<p>Psionic Logcheck will go through the messages file (and
others) on a regular basis (invoked via crontab usually) and
email out a report of any suspicious activity. It is easily
configurable with several &#145;classes&#146; of items, active
penetration attempts which is screams about immediately, bad
activity, and activity to be ignored (for example DNS server
statistics or SSH rekeying). Psionic Logcheck is available from: <a href="http://www.psionic.com/abacus/logcheck/">http://www.psionic.com/abacus/logcheck/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>colorlogs&nbsp;</h3>
<p>colorlogs will color code log files allowing you to easily
spot suspicious activity. Based on a config file it looks for
keywords and colors the lines (red, cyan, etc.), it takes input
from STDIN so you can use it to review log files quickly (by
using &#147;cat&#148;, &#147;tail&#148; or other utilities to
feed the log file through the program). You can get it at: <a href="http://www.resentment.org/projects/colorlogs/">http://www.resentment.org/projects/colorlogs/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WOTS</h3>
<p>WOTS collects log files from multiple sources and will
generate reports or take action based on what you tell it to do.
WOTS looks for regular expressions you define and then executes
the commands you list (mail a report, sound an alert, etc.). WOTS
requires you have Perl installed and is available from: <a href="http://www.hpcc.uh.edu/~tonyc/tools/">http://www.hpcc.uh.edu/~tonyc/tools/</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>swatch</h3>
<p>swatch is very similar to WOTS, and the log files
configuration is very similar. You can download swatch from: <a href="ftp://ftp.stanford.edu/general/security-tools/swatch/">ftp://ftp.stanford.edu/general/security-tools/swatch/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Kernel logging">Kernel logging</a></h2>
<p>The lowest level of logging possible is at the kernel level.
Generally speaking users cannot disabled of avoid this type of
logging, and also are usually not even aware it exists (a
defenite advantage).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>auditd</h3>
<p><a href="../kernel/index.html#auditd">Information is available
here.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Shell logging">Shell logging</a></h2>
<p>A variety of command shells have built in logging
capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>bash</h3>
<p>I will also cover bash since it is the default shell in most
Linux installations, and thus its logging facilities are
generally used. bash has a large number of variables you can
configure at run time or during it&#146;s use that modify how it
behaves. Everything from the command prompt style to how many
lines to keep in the log file.</p>
<p>HISTFILE<br>
name of the history file, by default it is
~username/.bash_history</p>
<p>HISTFILESIZE<br>
maximum number of commands to keep in the file, it rotates them
as needed.</p>
<p>HISTSIZE<br>
the number of commands to remember (i.e. when you use the up
arrow key).</p>
<p>The variables are typically set in /etc/profile, which
configures bash globally for all users, however, the values can
be over-ridden by users with the ~username/.bash_profile file,
and/or by manually using the export command to set variables such
as export EDITOR=emacs. This is one of the reasons that user
directories should not be world readable; the .bash_history file
can contain a lot of valuable information to a hostile party. You
can also set the file itself non world readable, set your
.bash_profile not to log, set the file non writeable (thus
denying bash the ability to write and log to it) or link it to
/dev/null (this is almost always a sure sign of suspicious user
activity, or a paranoid user). For the root account I would
highly recommend setting the HISTFILESIZE and HISTSIZE to a low
value such as 10. On the other hand if you want to log users
shell history and otherwise tighten up security I would recommend
setting the configuration files in the user&#146;s home directory
to immutable using the chattr command, and set the log files
(such as .bash_history) to append only. Doing this however opens
up some legal issues, so make sure your users are aware they are
being logged and have agreed to it, otherwise you could get into
trouble. Don't forget to set /hom/username/.bash_history append
only (chattr +A). </p>
