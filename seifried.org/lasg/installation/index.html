<p>How you install Linux will have a big impact on how much you
will be able to secure. If you install Linux from an untrusted
source you could potentially end up with an installation that has
backdoors or other security issues. If you install packages you
do not need and forget about there is a greater chance that
someone will be able to break in. As well there are security
tasks that are best accomplished during installation, attempting
to do them post install can be troublesome. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Verifying packages and files</h2>
<p>Some sources of install packages and files are safer then
others. Buying Linux on CD from a large vendor such as Red Hat at
a large store is relatively safe and the chances of acquiring a
trojan'ed CD set is very unlikely. Installing Linux via ftp from
a remote ftp server provides an attacker many avenues to replace
packages with modified versions. The good news is that most
vendors have addressed this problem. </p>
<p>Using public/private key cryptography most vendors have a
keypair that they use to sign packages, you can verify these
signatures with the public key. These public keys can be
downloaded online and most vendors include them on their CD's. A
list of vendor key names, ID's, fingerprints and the keys
themselves are available <a href="../vendor-keys/">here</a>. </p>
<p>You first need to download the vendors PGP or GnuPG key, for
example Red Hat&#146;s signing key has the identity of &quot;<font size="3"><a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="087b6d6b7d7a617c71487a6d6c60697c266b6765">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></font>&quot; and the fingerprint is:</p>
<p>CA20 8686 2BD6 9DFC 65F6 ECC4 2191 80CD DB42 A60E</p>
<p>Generally speaking you can download the vendor keys from their
websites, and many vendors ship the key on their CD&#146;s. To
verify a directory full of RPM&#146;s this simple script will
automate the task:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><font face="Albertus Extra Bold">[<a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b0c5c3d5c2f0c3d5c2c6d5c2">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> RPMS]# for a in *.rpm
&gt; do
&gt; rpm -K $a &gt;&gt; ~/sign-log
&gt; done</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The file sign-log should consists of lines like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ElectricFence-2.2.2-5.i386.rpm: md5 gpg OK
ImageMagick-5.2.2-5.i386.rpm: md5 gpg OK
ImageMagick-devel-5.2.2-5.i386.rpm: md5 gpg OK
Inti-0.5preview-1.i386.rpm: md5 gpg OK</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Installation Media</h2>
<p>You cannot secure your installation very well if an attacker
manages to compromise the system before you even install it.
While it is rare for an attacker to try and compromise
installation media it is certainly possible. The first step is to
verify the packages and installation files on your installation
media, this can be done by checking GnuPG signatures on the
RPM's/etc, and the other files, although finding the signatures
of the other files or MD5 sums is relatively tricky it is
possible. The next step is to secure the system providing the
files and the path between this system and the machine you are
installing the software on. This is very easy for example with a
CD-ROM, and much more tricky if doing an FTP or NFS install over
the Internet from a system you do not control. It is strongly
suggested you use a server that you control to host installation
files. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CD's</h3>
<p>CD's are typically the easiest to install from, and relatively
secure. If you purchase CD's from the vendor it is unlikely that
they have been somehow compromised, all you do is simply boot
from them and install the software. You can leave the machine
offline for the installation typically, and if you burn the
updates onto a CD you can easily update the system, again without
needing to bring it online. It is strongly recommended to keep a
set of vendor CD's around so that you can cleanly install
critical systems as needed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Harddrive</h3>
<p>Installing from a local harddrive is also a relatively secure
way of installing Linux. Simply partition the drive first (if you
are installing Linux to it) and then copy the files onto a
prepared partition, boot the system and away you go. Installing
from the harddrive provides many of the benefits of installing
from CD without the need to burn CD's. As well you can easily
copy all the updates to the drive and then install them on the
first reboot and bring the system completely up to date.
Additionally with the increased availability of external
harddrives utilizing parallel, FireWire and USB ports it is
relatively easy to plug a harddrive into a system without needing
to take it apart (assuming of course the installation floppy disk
supports it). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Network (FTP / NFS)</h3>
<p>These two methods are very convenient, all you need is a
single floppy disk (typically) and a server with all the files.
Simply mirror the directory structure you need (typically
something like /pub/redhat/7.1/en/i386) and then make it
accessible via ftp (anonymous or username/password required) or
via NFS (to the IP or subnet you use for installations). The
files only need to be readable, there is absolutely no need for
writing to them and in fact you are probably better off removing
the write bit for all to prevent &quot;accidents&quot;. These
network methods can also be combined with the automated
installations such as KickStart, or you can do you own custom
installation of sorts (by removing packages you do not want for
example). If you choose to do network installs it is critical
that the NFS/FTP server remains secure, to this end I highly
recommend using a protected subnet, not attached to your main
network if possible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Automating installs</h2>
<p>Automating installs can relieve tedium and prevent security
problems. If you have to do 100 Linux installs chances are you
will make error if you have to do them each manually. However if
you can create an automated installation that is secured then it
is much less likely that you will have problems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Red Hat Kickstart</h3>
<p>Red hat provides a facility for automating installs, which can
be very useful. Simply put you create a text file with various
specifications for the install, and point the Red Hat installer
at it, then sit back and let it go. This is very useful if
rolling out multiple machines, or giving users a method of
recovery (assuming their data files are safe). You can get more
information at: <a href="http://www.redhat.com/mirrors/LDP/HOWTO/KickStart-HOWTO.html">http://www.redhat.com/mirrors/LDP/HOWTO/KickStart-HOWTO.html</a>.
The configuration file can also be placed on a tftp server, in a
directory named for the IP address of the client, thus using a
dhcp/tftp server you can completely automate installs for
machines if you know the MAC address of the client machine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Filesystem layout and structuring</h2>
<p>There are a number of common attacks/exploits in Linux (and
UNIX) that can be reduced in risk and significance with a proper
directory and partition structure. One of the most common denial
of service attacks is to fill up the disk space with junk data,
this can also happen unintentionally with software that
experiences a problem. This is typically defended against by
assigning root a set percentage of the disk space as reserve
(usually 5-10%), so on a 10 gig disk users would not be able to
use the last 500 megs, this would be reserved for root. This
doesn't do you any good however if something running as root,
that generates log files, goes nuts, or is attacked and made to
generate massive log files. The next big attack that takes
advantage of disk setup would be /tmp races, and core dumps,
programs that create links or files improperly without checking
to make sure they exist first, especially programs that run as
root. An attacker can then link /tmp/foo to /etc/passwd and
potentially add a user account, wipe the password database out,
and so on. </p>
<p>Mounting options can be used to mount a partition read only,
not allow execution of programs, and other useful things. You may
encounter difficulties when using these options however, for
example if you mount /usr as read only you will have
significantly more work when upgrading system components,
especially on critical servers (such as e-commerce machines) that
need to be up and running, but also require critical updates.
More useful options are &quot;nosuid&quot; (no setuid or setgid
files), &quot;noexec&quot; (no executables) and &quot;nodev&quot;
(no device files). </p>
<p>So with this in mind we have several guidelines:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Put filesystems that users can write to on separate
partitions </li>
<li>Put filesystems with critical system
components/configuration on separate partitions </li>
<li>Consider mounting some partitions with system binaries as
read-only (this will make upgrades more difficult
however), mounting /bin/, /sbin/ and /etc/ separately
however will make booting the system tricky (depending on
your configuration), test this before using it in a
production environment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some notes on the various flags</p>
<p>noexec, if you mount /tmp noexec for example you can copy a
binary in, but it will not run, however if you execute it using
ld-linux.so it will work fine:</p>

<h2>Hardening your installation</h2>
<p>So you've got a fresh install of Linux (Red Hat, Debian,
whatever, please, please, DO NOT install really old versions and
try to upgrade them, it's a nightmare), but chances are there is
a lot of extra software installed, and packages you might want to
upgrade or things you had better upgrade if you don't want the
system compromised in the first 15 seconds of uptime (in the case
of BIND/Sendmail/etc.). Keeping a local copy of the updates
directory for your distributions is a good idea (there is a list
of errata for distributions at the end of this document), and
making it available via NFS/ftp or burning it to CD is generally
the quickest way to make it available. As well there are other
items you might want to upgrade, for instance imapd or bind. You
will also want to remove any software you are not using, and/or
replace it with more secure versions (such as replacing RSH with
SSH).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bastille Linux</h3>
<p>If you are running Mandrake / Red Hat or a similar Linux you
can use the Bastille Linux hardening script available at: <a href="http://www.bastille-linux.org/">http://www.bastille-linux.org/</a>.
It will disable various servers, install login banners and
generally automates many of the tasks a security administrator
will have to do in any event. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Harden SuSE</h3>
<p>Harden SuSE is a script specifically for SuSE Linux and
available from: <a href="http://www.suse.de/~marc/">http://www.suse.de/~marc/</a>.
Usage can be automated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Linux, like most UNIX systems uses a directory structure based
off of /, which directories like /home, /tmp, /usr, and so on.
These directories can be placed on the same partition, or
separate partitions, separating them properly can have security
(and performance) benefits. There are also a number of mounting
options that can be used to prevent common problems and attacks.</p>
